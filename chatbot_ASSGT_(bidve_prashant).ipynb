The market  for coffee b usinesses  is developing.   There is substantial \\ncompetition in the retail coffee business.  Examples of competitors  include n ational, regional and \\nlocal, franchised and independently owned coffee b usinesses, mail order, restaura nts, gr ocery \\nstores, bulk foo d stores , department stores  and convenience stores . \\n \\n The market for coffee businesses  could be affected by pandem ics, such as the COVID 19 \\npandemic.  These ef fects may be experience d while the pandemic and any soci al distancin g \\npolicies, volu ntary or mandatory shu tdowns, and other governmental policies and requirements \\nrelating to the pandemic are in effect.  The mar ket could also be affected by natural disaste rs, such \\nas hurricanes and floods.  The effects from pan demics and n atural  disasters  may include the \\nunavailability of employees, reduced hours of operation or closing of the business for a period of \\ntime, reduc ed sales v olumes and cash flows, and disrupti ons to supply chains.  \\n \\nRegulations  \\n \\n There are no regula tions specif ic to the indust ry in which the BIGGBY® COFFEE  franchise \\noperates.

As of Decem ber 31, 2020, there were 245 franchised Store s in operation.  For the \\ninformat ion in Charts 1 and 2 and for the s ame- store Unit Sales growth  information in \\nChart 3, we used revenue information from a subset of 202 of our 245 franchi sed Stores in \\noperation at t he end of  2020 (143 of these Stores , which are the Stores with a drive- thru, \\nare included in Chart 1 and 59 of thes e Stores , which are t he Stores without a drive -thru, \\nare included in Chart 2) .  These 202 Stores constitute all of the franchised S tores in \\noperation at the end of 2020 that were in operat ion for at l east 13  mont hs at the end of \\n2020, other than kiosk Stores (ki osk S tores are  Stores that are housed inside another retail \\nbusiness operation) and S tores that were not open seven days a week ; provided t hat, we \\nexcluded 20 Stores that were closed for at least 40 days in 2020 due to the COVID 19 \\npandemi c.  Some of the 202 Stores were closed for 39 days or less du ring 2020.   For the \\ninformation in Cha rt 3 (other than same- store Unit Sales growth) , Chart 4, and Chart 5 we \\nused revenue and expense informat ion from a subset of 71 of our 245 franchised Stores  in \\noperation at the end of  2020.  These 71 Stores are Stores that we believe provi de us with \\nconsistent and accurate expense data,  are a reasonable representation of o ur franchise \\nsyste m, and wer e closed for no more than 39 day s in 2020.  The Stores represented  in the \\nCharts may differ m aterially  from a Store that may be operated by you because these \\nStores have been operated for a longer  period of time and by a more experie nced \\noperator.   \\n 2. The informati on contained in Char t 1, Chart 2,  and C hart 3 is based on inf ormation \\nreported to us by the Stores  in each subset for the year ending December 31, 2020. \\nExcept as described below , the percentages  used f or the break -even analysis  in Chart 4 \\nare from the av erages of t he Chart 4 subset of  Store s for the year endi ng December  31, \\n2020.  We d etermined these averages based on information reported to us by these \\nStores.  Any al terations in t he data from t he Char t 4 subset are noted below .  The financ ial \\ninformation from our  Stores has not been audited a nd we do not know if the information \\nwas pr epared in accordanc e with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  \\n \\n3. “Unit Sales ,” as us ed in the Charts, means the entire revenues of the Store , less sales \\ntaxes  and refunds , but not including any reduction for disc ounts .  “Gross Sales,” as used in \\nthe Franchise Agreemen t, mean s all revenues of the S tore minus sales taxes paid, \\ndiscounts , and refunds.   \\n 4. The “Gross P rofit” as a percentage of the Unit  Sales  average of our Chart 4  subset of \\nStores, which is the perc entag e used in the bre ak-even anal ysis in Char t 4, is 62.31% .  \\nThe Gross Profi t is cal culated by taki ng Unit Sales and subtr acting d iscounts as an \\naverage percentage and then Cost of Sales as an average percentage.  61 of the 71 \\nStores  (85.91%) in th e subset g roup met or exc eeded t his average G ross Profit \\npercentage.  \\n 5. The “Operating Expenses”  as a percentage of the Unit Sales  used i n the break -even \\nanalysis in Chart 4 is 60.27%.  The detailed calculati on for this percentage is in Chart 5 \\nbelow.   Some of the Stores  in the Chart  4 subse t reported automoti ve and meal s and \\nentertainment expens es.  We di d not include t hose expenses in our  analysis .  There are 5  \\nGlobal Orange Development, LLC  \\nFDD Dated April 30,  2021  44 subcategories under Operating Expenses.  Those subcategories and cer tain ass umptions  \\nrelating to thos e subcat egories are as  follows : \\n \\n(A) Labor —29.62% .  This subcategory includes the pers onnel cost s in Chart  3.  The \\nlabor expenses subc ategor y is not an average of the subset Stores, but is instead \\nan as sumption based on two baristas at $ 9.65 per hour ( minimum  wage in \\nMichigan as of January 1, 2020) for 1 6.5 hours per day.  This does not incl ude a \\nmanager’s salary.  This percentage includes work er’s compensation insurance, \\npayroll taxes and training ex pens es relating to the two barist a employ ees, w hich is  \\nbased on informat ion from  the subset Stores.  \\n \\n(B) Services— 9.93%.  This subcategory inclu des the l aundry, uniform s, bank service \\ncharges , credit card processing, insurance, license and permits, penalties and \\nfines, professional servi ces, telephone and ut ilities expenses i n Chart 5 . \\n (C) Administration— 9.97%.  This subcategory includes the office suppli es, postage, \\noccupancy cost, including rent, and travel expenses in Chart 5 .   \\n (D) Marketing and Royalty —8.73%.  This subcategor y incl udes the adver tising,  \\nmarketing and franchise r oyalty expenses in Chart 5 .  Some Stor es included in this \\nanalys is pay a r oyalty of 5% of  Gross Sales  and others  pay a royalty of 6% of Gross \\nSales .  New franchi ses will pay a royalty of 6% of Gross Sal es, which will increase \\nthis percentage.   \\n \\n(E) Operati ons—2.06%.  This subcategor y includes the smallwar es, chemicals,  freight, \\nmaintenance and repair expenses in Chart 5. \\n \\n6. There is no depreciation or amorti zation expensed in the C hart 4 break -even analysis.  \\n 7. The i nteres t expense under the “Other Income  (Expens e)” category in C hart 4 is not  an \\naverage of the subset Sto res but  is instead an ass umption based on bor rowing  $150,000 \\nat 6% interest.  There are  no principal payments expenses in these calculations.  \\n \\n8. The “Net Income” shown i n the break -even analysis i n Chart 4 is $0 as this C hart is \\nintended to show a break -even scenario. The average Net Income for our Chart 4 subset \\nof Stores, which includes officer/guaranteed payments and automotive and meals and \\nentertainment expenses but does not include depreciati on or amortization, is $85,325.03  \\n(the median is $97, 921). Net Income as a percentage of the Unit  Sales average of our \\nChart 4 subset of St ores, which is the percentage used in the break -even analysis in Chart \\n4, is 11.56%  (the m edian is 13.27% ).  The Net Income is calculated by taking Gross \\nIncome and subtracting Operating Expenses as an average percentage and then Other \\nIncome (Expenses) as an average percentage.  57 of the 71 St ores in the subset group \\n(80.28% ) met or exceeded this average Gross Profit percentage \\n 9. In arrivin g at the number of cups s old per day to break -even, we hav e assumed Unit Sales \\nper cup of $5.96.  This figure is not an av erage of the Chart 4  subset of Stores but  is an \\naverage of the Chart 1  and Chart 2 subset of Stores .  \\n \\n10. The Gross Margin percen tage is calcul ated by  taking Unit Sales and subtracting Cost of \\nGoods Sold as an averag e perc entage.  \\n  \\nGlobal Orange Development, LLC  \\nFDD Dated April 30,  2021  45 11. The Labor percentage includ es both fixed and variable labor costs and is calculated by  \\ndividi ng labor c osts by Unit  Sales . Some S tores’ labor costs in clude a mana ger’s salary \\nwhile other St ores do not because the franc hisee act s as t he manager and may not take a \\nsalary.  \\n \\n \\nCHART 1  \\nANNUAL DRIVE -THRU UNIT SALES FOR 2020  \\n \\n Number \\nof Stores  Average \\nUnit Sales  Number and % \\nat or Ab ove \\nAver age Median Unit \\nSales Highe st Unit \\nSale s Lowest Unit \\nSales  \\nSystemwide  143 $759,379  67 47%  $745,069  $1,608,964 1 $375,902  \\nTop Quarter 36 $1,030,586  14 39%  $976,869  $1,608,964  $866,117  \\nUpper Middl e 36 $805,615  16 44%  $769,914  $865,174  $745,069  \\nLower Middle  35 $685,426  21 60%  $700,657  $738,682  $614,873  \\nBottom Quartil e 36 $513,835  17 47%  $511,769  $613,534  $375,902  \\n \\n(1)  15  Stores had Unit Sales  of above $1,000,000 in 2020.  \\n \\nCHART  2 \\nANNUAL NON -DRIVE -THRU UNIT  SALES FOR 2020  \\n \\n Numbe r \\nof Stores  Average \\nUnit Sales  Number and %  \\nat or Above \\nAverage  Median Unit \\nSales Highe st Unit \\nSale s Lowest Unit \\nSales  \\nSystemwide  59 $443,438 26 44%  $413,937 $954,375 $184,490 \\nTop Quarter 14 $665,590 4 29%  $633,977 $954,375 $515,895 \\nUpper Middl e 15 $466,417  6 40%  $460,522 $509,420 $422,913 \\nLowe r Middle  15 $380,208 5 33%  $386,217 $413,937 $346,313 \\nBottom Quartile  15 $276,347 7 47% $264,843 $334,280 $184,490 \\n  \\nGlobal Orange Development, LLC  \\nFDD Dated April 30,  2021  46 CHART 3 \\nEXPE NSES AND S AME -STORE UNIT  SALES GROWTH  FOR 2020  \\n \\n Number of \\nStores  Average  Number an d % at or \\nAbove Average  Media n \\nCost of Good s Sol d 71 22.31%  43 61% 21.98%  \\nGross Margi n 71 77.69%  43 61% 78.02%  \\nLabor 71 30.04%  41 58%  29.59%  \\nSame -Store Unit Sale s \\nGrowth(1) 202 10.48%  93 46%  9.72%  \\n \\n(1)  In the last 1 0 years, we have ha d positi ve same  store Unit Sales growth in every quarter except one . \\n  \\nGlobal Orange Development, LLC  \\nFDD Dated April 30,  2021  47 CHAR T 4 \\nSTATEMENT OF REVE NUE AND EXP ENSES AND CUPS SOLD PER DA Y TO BREAK -EVEN  \\n \\nUNIT  SALES     \\n Beverag e    $371,982 .86   \\n Food     $62,847.75   \\n Nontaxable Foods     $4,229.10   \\n Merchandise & gifts    $1,430.79   \\n Other sa les    $1,149.93   \\n        \\n TOTAL UNIT  SALES    $441,640.43   \\n        \\n LESS:      \\n  Sales discounts     $(68,965. 56)  15.62%  \\n       \\n        \\n UNIT  SALES NET OF DISCOUNTS    $372,674.87   \\n        \\nCOST OF SALES      \\n Beverage     $62,326.62  14.11%  \\n Food     $18,532.15  4.20%   \\n Nontax able food     $1,945.39  0.44%  \\n Merchandise & gifts     $1,433.02  0.32%  \\n Disp osables  & paper     $13,240. 13  3.00%  \\n        \\n  TOTAL COST OF SALES    $97,477.31  22.07%  \\n        \\n  GROSS PROFIT    $275,197.56  62.31%  \\n        \\nOPERATING EXPENS ES     \\n (See Chart 5)   $266,197.56  60.27%  \\n        \\nINCOME (L OSS) - OPERATIONS   $9,000.00   \\n        \\nOTHER INCOME (E XPENSE)      \\n Intere st    $(9,000.00)   \\n Other inco me   $0 0.00%  \\n        \\nOTHER INCOME ( EXPENS E) NET   $(9,000. 00)  -2.04%  \\n        \\nNET INCO ME (LOSS)     $0.00   \\n        \\n   CUPS NEEDED PER DA Y FOR BREAK -EVEN:  204  \\n  \\nGlobal Orange Development, LLC  \\nFDD Dated April 30,  2021  48 CHART 5 \\nOPERATING EXPEN SES D ETAIL FOR CH ART 4 \\n \\nOPERATING EXPENSES      \\n Personnel cos ts:     \\n  Salaries & wages - emp loyee s    $115,597.35   \\n  Salaries & wages - managers     $ -0-               \\n  Insurance - health       $ -0-  \\n  Insurance - worker\\'s com p    $ 658.28  \\n  Payroll ta xes      $ 12,852.42   \\n  Hiring & training costs       $ 1,696. 47  \\n Smallwares       $ 1,394.83   \\n Chem icals       $ 973.52  \\n Laundry  & Uniforms       $ 2,863.20   \\n Advertis ing      $ 19,776.0 1  \\n Bank Service charges       $ 511.51   \\n Credit card proces s expense     $ 9,280.0 6  \\n Dues and Subscriptions     $ 932.72   \\n Freight       $ 50.03   \\n Insurance  - Gene ral      $ 2,859.16   \\n Maintenance       $ 3,013.84   \\n Royalty Fees       $ 18,625.04   \\n License and Permit fees       $ 656.36   \\n Office Supplie s      $ 2,162.82   \\n Penalties & Fines       $ 426.28   \\n Postage    $ 181.95  \\n Professional Services       $ 10,882 .66  \\n Rent        $ 36,288.41   \\n Repairs       $ 3,672.97   \\n Taxes    $ 2,742. 18  \\n Telephone       $ 2,580.98   \\n Travel       $ 1,731.56   \\n Utilities       $ 13,786.97   \\n        \\n  TOTAL OPERAT ING E XPENSES   $ 266,197 .56  60.27%  \\n \\n \\nCaution  \\n \\nSome franchi ses ha ve sold this amount .

Our philosophy is that technology should never hinder the daily operations of your  busines s. \\nTechnology should smoothly integrate into and facilitate the operations of a BIGGBY COFFEE s tore.  \\n \\nIn an effort to keep fees to a minimum, Global Orange operates the support contract on a revenue -neutral basis. \\nIt is our objective to restrict fees collected from the Franchise Owner to the actual cost of providing the service.  \\n 1. Benefits  \\n By accepting the support contract , you will receive the benefits described below. The end goal of these services \\nis to keep your POS equipment functio nal and up -to-date at all times at a reasonable cost  to you.  \\n \\na. Hardware and Software Support  \\n \\nAll hardware and software that has been purchased from us or approved by us is covered for technical \\nissues, defects, and failures , subject to the exclusions described below. We will troubleshoot and repair, \\nthrough a variety of means o utlined later in the support contract, any issues that affect your system.  \\n b. Hardware Upgrades  \\n \\nWe want BIGGBY COFFEE stores to be running on the newest and most r eliable equipment that our \\ntechnology budget will allow. O lder equipment be comes less reliable as it ages and cost -prohibitive to \\nmaintain. As a method for preventing long- term system ic problems , the  support contract provides hardware \\nlife-cycle management.  \\n All hardware will be reviewed annually, and replaced or reconfigured every 5 -7 years; earlier, in the event of \\na hardware failure or the determination that technology is “end of life”.  \\n At the time of a swap, you will relinquish ownership of the old piece of equipment and accept ownership of \\nthe new or refurbis hed piece of equipment.   We will make a best -effort attempt to transfer all personal \\ndata  and software licensing  to the replacement equipment.  The replacement equipment will continue to be \\ncovered under this contract . \\n \\nA special cash assessment, beyond t he cost of this contract, may be required in order to keep up with \\ntechnology changes. These required assessments will be kept to a minimum cost and frequency.  We will provide a minimum of 60 -day notice of any upcoming assessments, longer if possible.  \\n \\nc. Proactive Services  \\n \\nOne of the best ways to keep systems running at their maximum performance  and prevent failures before \\nthey happen is through continuous monitoring and regular maintenance.  \\n Global Orange Development, LLC  \\nMaintenance and Support Contract -Exhibit H \\nFDD Dated April 30, 2021  2 \\n  BIGGBY has an established store technology standard that is continuously updated.  With this support \\ncontract, we continually monitor systems for issues and routinely provide proactive services.  \\n The following is a sample of the proactive services included:  \\n \\ni. Up/down status of store internet connectivity.  \\nii. Anti-virus  and anti-malware prevention . \\niii. Windows and supported software patch management.  \\niv. Available storage capacity.  \\n \\nd. Backup Internet  \\n Internet connectivity is essential for running your business. This agreement includes cellular backup internet service with automatic failover and failback.  There are no data limits for this service if it is used only for POS \\nservices. However, if it is used for anything else, you may be billed for data overages.  There are no guaranteed data speeds for this service. The data s peeds will be limited by the strength of the signal at your \\nlocation, the interference encountered within your office, the capabilities of your modem, and other factors.  \\nThe initial cost and replacement cost of this device is NOT covered by this agreement.  \\n 2. Coverage  \\n \\na. Hardware  \\n \\nAll hardware provided by us is covered under this support contract. We will diagnose and repair issues \\nrelating to hardware defects, hardware failures, inconsistent hardware performance, and environmental causes. The coverage extends  to: \\ni. Back of house computer  \\nii. POS terminals  \\niii. Cash drawers  \\niv. Printers  \\nv. Firewall/routers  \\nvi. Power devices  \\nvii. Networking components  \\n \\nb.

Issues arising from hardware or software not provided by Global Orange Development  \\nii. Damage caused by accident, m isuse , neglect, acts of God, vandalism, theft, or riot  \\n In the event of an exclusion the owner/operator will be informed, and Global Orange Development will bill the store for any excluded hardware, software, or services.  \\n \\nPrior to installing any additional hardware on your own or through a 3rd party, please contact Global Orange \\nDevelopment to obtain consent.  \\n Global Orange Development, LLC  \\nMaintenance and Support Contract -Exhibit H \\nFDD Dated April 30, 2021  3 \\n  c. Software  \\n \\nAll software installed by us is also covered under this support contract. We will troubleshoot and resolve \\nissues relating to software configuration, software crashes,  and malwar e such as viruses. The coverage \\nextends to:  \\ni. Operating System  \\nii. POS Software  \\niii. Microsoft Office  \\n \\nd. Internet  \\n \\nWith this support contract,  if you experience issues with internet access, we will determine if the issue is \\nwith the service provider or hardware in the store and we will assist you in finding a resolution . This could \\ninclude replacement of hardware or a conference call with your service provider.  \\n \\ne. Data Security Requirements  \\n You understand that you must comply with industry standards and all applicable laws relating to the \\nprotection of customer information and other personal information , including the Payment Card Industry \\n(“PCI”) Data Security Standard (“DSS”) Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures and other applicable PCI requireme nts.  It is your responsibility to research and understand the PCI requirements, \\nother industry standards, and applicable laws and to ensure that your business policies and practices comply with these requirements.  Notwithstanding the services we provide under this support contract, you will be \\nsolely responsible for any liability, damages or claims caused by any data breaches or your failure to comply \\nwith these industry standards and laws.  \\n \\n3. Expectations  \\n \\na. Process for Hardware and Software Support  \\n \\nThe following is an outline of the steps that will be taken when there is a support issue.  \\n \\ni. Phone and Remote Support  \\n \\nWhenever you have an issue with your POS System, you can start the support process by calling in to the Franchise Community Line  (517-492-4521), or  by sending an e -mail to \\ntickets@biggby.com\\n with a description of t he issue . \\n When calling the Franchise Community Line  you will either speak with so meone directly or be \\nredirected to a voice mail that goes direc tly to our ticketing system.  You can expect to hear back \\nfrom someone  as outlined in the response times later i n the support contract.  \\n Once you are in touch with a technician, they will remote ly connect to your system to diagnose \\nand attempt to fix the problem. If connectivity is unavailable, they will provide phone support to \\nget a connection up and running, and then resume with resolving the issue.  \\n Global Orange Development, LLC  \\nMaintenance and Support Contract -Exhibit H \\nFDD Dated April 30, 2021  4 \\n  ii. Replacement Parts  \\n \\nIf a technician determines that your issue is caused by a faulty piece of hardware, we will \\nattempt to put your system into one of the various modes of redundancy to at least get you up \\nand running for the time being.   This could entail  putting the terminal in standalone mode, \\nchanging network setups, or any of a number of temporary fixes.  \\n If the store is a non -drive thru location , a technician will bring the replacement hardware to the \\nstore. If the store is a drive thru location and has at least one functioning POS , the technician \\nwill ship out a replacement piece of equipment overnight. Included in this will be a box  or return \\nlabel for you to re turn the old piece of equipment.  \\n Once you have the equipment, you can contact the Franchise Community Line to have them \\nconnect you with a technician that will walk you through replacing the equipment. They will \\nthen verify everything is working and make sure your data and settings are intact.  \\n \\niii. Continued Support and On- Site Service  \\n \\nIf for any reason your problem persists beyond a replacement part, we will try further troubleshooting to fix the issue. If we are able to , we will find  a suitable solution via another \\nreplacement part. However, if we are unsure of what the problem is, or if you have replaced two separate replacement parts and the issue persists, we will send out a technician on -site to \\nservice your system.  If when at the  site the technician determines the cause of the issue is \\nrelated to user error, or other devices not installed or supported by Global Orange Development \\nyou may be billed for services . \\n \\nb. Emergency vs. Non- Emergency  \\n \\nIMPORTANT: All emergencies must be called in  to the FCL.  \\n \\nThe primary factor that will determine how we prioritize  support tickets is whether the issue is considered \\nan emergency.  We define a n emergency  as something that completely disables one of the core \\ntechnological functions of your  business . For the purposes of response times and after -hours support, an \\nemergency must be one of the following:  \\ni. You are unable to ring up orders on the POS terminal.  \\nii. You are unable to accept credit card transactions.  \\niii. Your back of house computer  is unresponsive or unable to start.  \\niv. Your internet has been consistently down for more than 30 minutes.  \\n \\nc. Support Hours  \\n \\ni. Monday through Friday  \\na.

Saturday through Sun day Global Orange Development, LLC  \\nMaintenance and Support Contract -Exhibit H \\nFDD Dated April 30, 2021  5 \\n  a. Emergency on call phone support is available from 12:00AM Saturday through 12:00AM \\nMonday  \\nIf it is determined that an on -site technician is needed, on -site support hours will revolve around technician \\navailability .  \\n \\nd. Response Times  \\n \\nPhone support will be responded to on both a time and priority basis. When calling during regular support \\nhours (above), emergencies will be responded to within 30 minutes .  Non-emergenci es will be responded to \\nwithin 1 hour . When calling outside of regular supp ort hours, emergenci es will be responded to within 1 \\nhour , while non -emergenc ies will be responded to wi thin 1  hour  of the opening hour of the next normal \\nbusiness  day. Replacement parts will be shipped overnight within 24 hours of determining a replacement \\npart is needed. On -site support times will vary by location. For emergencies, we will dispatch a technician \\nwithin 24 hours of determining a technician is needed. For non -emergencies, we will dispatch a technician \\nwithin 48 hours of determining a technician is needed.  \\n 4. Cost  \\n \\na. Monthly Cost  \\n The mo nthly cost of the support contract is $ 99 per month  for one -terminal stores, or $ 125 per month for \\ntwo-terminal stores.  \\n \\nb. Payment  \\n \\nBilling and payment for the support contract will be handled in the same manner and timeline in which your \\nroyalty is handled. You will see a separate line -item on your monthly royalty invoice for the cost of the \\nprogram.  \\n \\nc. Changes in Cost  \\n \\nNo more than onc e per year, we will re -evaluate the cost of the program to account for increases and \\ndecreases that may occur in  our cost of administering this service .

Monthly bills will \\ncontinue to accrue.  \\n Global Orange Development, LLC  \\nMaintenance and Support Contract -Exhibit H \\nFDD Dated April 30, 2021  6 \\n  b. Changes to Contract Terms  \\n \\nNo more than once per year, we will re -evaluate the terms of the support contract based on customer \\nfeedback and n ew technology or methods that are available. If any changes are made, you will be notified at \\nleast 2 months’ prior to the effective date.  \\n \\nc. Effective Date  \\n \\ni.

If we do, we will provide 60 days’ written notice to you. We will provide any data or support history on your store to you or any third parties at your request.

We\\nconducted our audits  in accordance with auditing standards generally  accepted in the United States of America .\\nThose standards require that we plan and perform the audits  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\\nconsolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.  \\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the\\nconsolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the\\nassessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or\\nerror. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity ’s preparation\\nand fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are\\nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\\nentity ’s internal control. Accordingly , we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the\\nappropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by\\nmanagem ent, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit\\nopinion .\\nOpinion\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the\\nfinancial position of Global Orange Developm ent, LLC and Affiliates  as of December 31, 2020 , 2019, and 2018\\nand the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting\\nprinciples generally  accepted in the United States of America.\\nApril 23, 2021\\n1Global Orange Development, LLC and A ffiliates\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\\n2020 2019 2018\\nAssets\\nCurrent A ssets\\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,616,220 $ 2,093,673 $ 2,526,367\\nInvestments 80,642 749,423 -\\nAccounts receivable :\\nTrade 1,102,415 1,019,350 1,008,238\\nRelated party  (Note 8) 43,827 116,000 64,000\\nInventory 332,566 334,756 186,176\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 309,966 102,824 121,765\\nTotal current assets 7,485,636 4,416,026 3,906,546\\nProperty and Equipment  -

Nature of Business\\nGlobal Orange Developm ent, LLC (Developm ent) is a limited liability  company  established in 1998 to\\nobtain the franchisor rights for BIGGBY COFFEETM. These rights extend to the use of the BIGGBY\\nCOFFEETM name, as well as its products and services. Development provides services to franchisees and\\nlicensed BIGGBY COFFEETM shops in Michigan, as well as the midwestern and southeastern United\\nStates.\\nGlobal Orange, LLC and Subsidiaries (Orange) is a limited liability  company  that owns the trademarks and\\nlicenses for BIGGBY COFFEETM. It is owned by  the members of Global Orange Development, LLC.\\nBiggby  Coffee Gift Card Fund, Inc. (eCard Fund) is a nonstock corporation established in 2015 to account\\nfor all of the activity  generated by the sale and use of gift cards. It is owned by the members of Global\\nOrange Development, LLC.\\nBiggby  Coffee Advertising Fund, Inc. (Ad Fund) is a nonstock corporation established in 2015 to account\\nfor all of the activity  related to advertising generated by the home office for the use of all Biggby\\nfranchises. It is owned by  the members of Global Orange Development, LLC.\\nMilkster, Inc. (Milkster) is a C corporation established in 2017 to offer and sell Milkster franchises, as well\\nas sell products and services to the franchisees. Milkster is owned 51 percent by Orange and 49 percent\\nby other stockholders. The balances of Milkster have been consolidated with Orange.  \\nGlobal Orange International Developm ent, LLC (International) is a limited liability  company  wholly owned\\nby Orange and created to develop franchisees outside of the United States. The balances of International\\nhave been consolidated into Orange.\\nNote 2 - Significant A ccounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation \\nThe accompany ing consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Global Orange\\nDevelopm ent, LLC and its variable interest entities (VIEs), Orange, Ad Fund, and eCard Fund, for which\\nDevelopm ent is the primary  beneficiary  (collectively , the \"Com pany \"). Orange includes the accounts of\\nGlobal Orange, LLC and its majority-owned subsidiaries, Milkster and International. All significant\\nintercompany  transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\nThe effects of eliminations of revenue and expenses due to intercompany  transactions between majority-\\nowned subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs are not attributed to noncontrolling interests in the VIEs.\\nCash Equivalents \\nThe Company  considers all investments with an original maturity  of three months or less when purchased\\nto be cash equivalents. \\nInvestments \\nInvestments in fixed-income securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included\\nin earnings, except to the extent that the investments are held in an agency  capacity  on behalf of the\\nfranchisees to fund the liability  for unredeemed gift cards, in which case the gains or losses are attributed\\nto the fund liability .\\n6Global Orange Development, LLC and A ffiliates\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\\nNote 2 - Significant A ccounting Policies  (Continued)\\nAccounts Receivable \\nAccounts receivable are stated at the amount managem ent expects to collect from outstanding balances.\\nManagem ent provides for probable uncollected amounts through a provision for bad debt expense and an\\nadjustment to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts.\\nBalances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off\\nthrough a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. No allowances for\\ndoubtful accounts receivable were deem ed necessary  based on managem ent\\'s estimates at December\\n31, 2020 , 2019 , or 2018 .\\nInventory \\nInventory  consists primarily  of supplies and technology  equipm ent for resale to franchisees. Inventory  is\\nstated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO)\\nmethod.\\nProperty and Equipment \\nProperty  and equipm ent are recorded at cost. Both straight-line and accelerated methods are used for\\ncomputing depreciation and amortization. Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, except\\nin the case of leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the useful life or the remaining term of\\nthe lease, whichever is shorter. Costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.\\nGift Card Liability \\nThe Company  acts as a clearinghouse for its franchisees\\' gift card (eCard) transactions. On a quarterly\\nbasis, franchisees are billed or paid for the amount of eCard sales over or under eCard redemptions at the\\nrespective franchisees\\' store for the period. The gift card liability  represents the amounts owed to\\nfranchisees for unredeemed gift cards. \\nPostemployment Benefits \\nPostemploy ment benefits are recognized as a liability  and expense when the employee accepts the offer\\nand the amount can be reasonably  estimated. The liability  is calculated based upon the estimated present\\nvalue of future benefits to be paid. The benefits are to be paid through June 2022.\\nRevenue Recognition \\nThe Company \\'s revenue from operations mainly  consists of franchise fees, roy alties, advertising fees, and\\nthe sale of inventory  to franchisees. The Company  sells individual franchisees the right to operate a\\nBiggby  coffee shop within a defined territory  using the franchise name. The initial term of franchise\\nagreements is ty pically  10 y ears for Biggby  Coffee shops or 5 y ears for Milkster locations, with an option to\\nrenew for a fee or transfer the franchise agreement to a new or existing franchisee, at which point a\\ntransfer fee is ty pically  paid. \\n7Global Orange Development, LLC and A ffiliates\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\\nNote 2 - Significant A ccounting Policies  (Continued)\\nThe Company  has obligations to provide franchisees with the franchise rights to operate a Biggby  coffee\\nshop, training, and site selection. The Company  has concluded that these preopening activities represent\\nperformance obligations to which the franchise fee is allocated. Therefore, initial franchise fees for each\\nagreement are allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as these preopening activities\\nare performed, which typically  aligns with the date a franchisee opens. However, the Company  has\\nconcluded that the franchise fees paid by Milkster franchisees represent a single performance obligation.\\nTherefore, the initial franchise fee for each Milkster franchise agreement is recognized over the term of\\nthe respective franchise agreement from the date the location is opened. Transfer fees and renewal fees\\nare recognized in the period the transfer or renewal agreement is executed. Income for royalties and\\nadvertising fees is recognized over the term of the respective franchise agreement as the underly ing sales\\noccur. Income for the sale of inventory  to franchisees is recognized at the time the product is shipped to\\nthe franchisee. Revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and income has been disaggregated\\naccordingly .\\nThe cumulative effect of change in accounting principle presented on the consolidated statement of\\nmembers\\' deficit relates to the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update, issued by the Financial\\nAccounting Standards Board, that amends the guidance for revenue recognition. The amendm ent was\\nadopted on January  1, 2019. Under the new standard, Biggby  continues to recognize initial franchise fees\\nupon opening of a franchise location. However, Milkster\\'s franchise fees are now being deferred over the\\ncontract period.\\nPayment Terms\\nInitial franchise and transfer fees are due and typically  paid when a franchise agreement is entered into\\nand are nonrefundable. Royalties and advertising fees are paid on a periodic basis, no longer than\\nmonthly, based upon a percentage of franchisee net sales. Franchise fees are collected prior to the\\nsatisfaction of the Company \\'s performance obligation for Milkster franchises, resulting in the Company\\nrecognizing contract liabilities. Pay ment for inventory  purchases is due upon receipt of the related goods.\\nAllocating the Transaction Price\\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company  expects to be entitled in\\nexchange for providing franchisees with the franchise rights to operate a franchised location. To determine\\nthe transaction price, the Company  considers its customary  business practices and the terms of the\\nunderly ing agreement. For the purpose of determining transaction prices, the Company  assumes\\nperformance obligations will be satisfied as promised in accordance with franchise agreements and that\\nagreements will not be canceled, renewed, or modified.\\nThe Company \\'s franchise agreements with franchisees have transaction prices that contain a fixed and\\nvariable component. Variable consideration includes revenue related to royalties and advertising fees, as\\nthe transaction price is based on the franchisees\\' sales. The license of the franchise right is the\\npredominant item to which the roy alty relates; therefore, the variable consideration is recognized based on\\nthe actual amounts incurred each month. \\nAdvertising Expense \\nIn accordance with the standard franchise agreement, the Company  receives certain advertising fees from\\nits franchises. The goal of the advertising fund is to maximiz e general public recognition and patronage of\\nthe BIGGBY COFFEETM trademarks and systems. Fees assessed in excess of costs incurred are\\nrecorded as unexpended advertising fees, and costs incurred in excess of fees assessed are recorded as\\naccounts receivable. The Company  charges a managem ent fee for administration of the advertising fund,\\nwhich is elim inated in consolidation.\\n8Global Orange Development, LLC and A ffiliates\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\\nNote 2 - Significant A ccounting Policies  (Continued)\\nIncome Taxes \\nDevelopm ent and International have elected to be treated as partnerships, and Orange has elected to be\\ntreated as an S corporation for federal income tax purposes. Federal income taxes are not payable by, or\\nprovided for, the Company . Mem bers are taxed individually  on their shares of the Company ’s earnings.\\nThe Company ’s net income or loss is allocated among the members in accordance with the requirements\\nof the operating agreements.\\nAd Fund and eCard Fund have elected to be treated as nonstock corporations and are exempt from\\nfederal income taxes.\\nMilkster is a C corporation. A current tax liability  or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or\\nrefundable on tax returns for the year for Milkster. Deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognized for the\\nestimated future tax effects of temporary  differences between financial reporting and tax accounting.\\nGuaranteed Payments to M embers \\nGuaranteed payments to members that are intended as compensation for services rendered are\\naccounted for as compensation expense, a component of operating expenses.\\nCost of Product Sales \\nThe Company  includes purchased materials, freight costs, and various other direct and indirect costs in\\ncost of sales for its product sales.\\nAdvertising and M arketing \\nThe Company  incurred advertising, marketing, and promotion expense of approximately  $3,129,000 ,\\n$3,129,000 , and $3,077,000  in 2020, 2019, and 2018 , respectively . These items are expensed as\\nincurred.\\nShipping and Handling Costs \\nShipping and handling costs on product sales are recorded as costs of sales as they  are incurred. \\nMember Distributions \\nDuring 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 , the Company  made distributions of $2,563,684 , $2,354,836 , and\\n$2,422,960 , respectively , resulting in a members\\' deficit at December 31, 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 . For the\\npurpose of the distribution, the Company  valued the assets and liabilities of the Company  at fair valuation,\\nas permitted under the Michigan Limited Liability  Company  Act. The amount of members\\' equity  based on\\nthat valuation exceeded the recorded amount under generally  accepted accounting principles.\\nUse of Estimates \\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity  with generally  accepted accounting\\nprinciples requires managem ent to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated\\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\\nReclassification \\nLong-term deferred initial franchise fees as of December 31, 2019 have been reclassified to conform to\\nthe December 31, 2020 presentation. Previously , these deferred initial franchise fees were presented as a\\ncurrent liability  on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n9Global Orange Development, LLC and A ffiliates\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\\nNote 2 - Significant A ccounting Policies  (Continued)\\nGovernment Grants\\nThe Company  has elected to account for loan funds received under the Paycheck Protection Program\\n(PPP) as in-substance government grants. Accounting principles generally  accepted in the United States\\nof America (U.S. GAAP) do not include guidance on the accounting for government grants by for-profit\\nentities. As a result, the Company  has elected to analogize to the guidance in International Accounting\\nStandards (IAS) Statem ent 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government\\nAssistance (IAS 20). While IAS 20 does not represent authoritative guidance for entities preparing U.S.\\nGAAP financial statements, use of this guidance by  analogy  is permitted.\\nUnder IAS 20, government grants, including forgivable government loans, are recognized as income when\\nit is probable that the Company  will comply  with the conditions of the grant and that the grant will be\\nreceived. The Company  recognizes proceeds under grant programs in a systematic basis over the period\\nin which the Company  recognizes as expenses the related costs for which the grant is intended to\\ncompensate. The Company  has further elected to record the grant income separately  from the related\\nexpenses in nonoperating income.\\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\\nOn March 11, 2020, the W orld Health Organization declared the outbreak of a respiratory  disease caused\\nby a new coronavirus a pandemic. First identified in late 2019 and now known as COVID-19, the outbreak\\nhas impacted thousands of individuals worldwide. In response, the United States and various state and\\nlocal governments have implem ented measures to combat the outbreak that have severely  impacted\\nbusiness operations. Operations of the Company  were not significantly  impacted, as franchisees were\\nallowed to stay  open throughout the pandemic.\\nNo impairments were recorded as of December 31, 2020; however, the extent of any  future impact cannot\\nbe reasonably  estimated at this time.\\nUpcoming Accounting Pronouncements  \\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will supersede the current lease\\nrequirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 840. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a\\nright-to-use asset and related lease liability  for all leases, with a limited exception for short-term leases.\\nLeases will be classified as either finance or operating, with the classification affecting the pattern of\\nexpense recognition in the statement of operations. Currently , leases are classified as either capital or\\noperating, with only capital leases recognized on the balance sheet. The reporting of lease-related\\nexpenses in the statements of operations and cash flows will be generally  consistent with the current\\nguidance. The new lease guidance will be effective for the Company \\'s year ending December 31, 2022\\nand will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method to either the beginning of the earliest\\nperiod presented or the beginning of the y ear of adoption.  The Company  is still evaluating which method it\\nwill apply . The new lease standard is expected to have a significant effect on the Company ’s financial\\nstatements as a result of the Company \\'s operating leases, as disclosed in Note 10 , that will be reported on\\nthe consolidated balance sheet at adoption. Upon adoption, the Company  will recognize a lease liability\\nand corresponding right-to-use asset based on the present value of the minimum lease payments. The\\neffects on the results of operations are not expected to be significant, as recognition and measurement of\\nexpenses and cash flows for leases will be substantially  the same under the new standard. \\n10Global Orange Development, LLC and A ffiliates\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\\nNote 2 - Significant A ccounting Policies  (Continued)\\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):\\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The ASU includes changes to the accounting\\nand measurement of financial assets, including the Company \\'s accounts receivable, by requiring the\\nCompany  to recognize an allowance for all expected losses over the life of the financial asset at\\norigination. This is different from the current practice where an allowance is not recognized until the losses\\nare considered probable. The new guidance will be effective for the Company \\'s year ending December 31,\\n2023. Upon adoption, the ASU will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method to the\\nbeginning of the earliest period presented.\\nSubsequent Events \\nThe consolidated financial statements and related disclosures include evaluation of events up through and\\nincluding April 23, 2021 , which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be\\nissued.\\nNote 3 - Paycheck Protection Program Loan\\nDuring the y ear ended December 31, 2020, the Company  received a Pay check Protection Program loan in\\nthe amount of $784,022. The PPP loan program was created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and\\nEconomic Security  (CARES) Act and is administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Under\\nthe terms of this program, the loan may be fully or partially  forgiven if the loan proceeds are spent on\\nqualify ing expenses and if staffing level and salary  maintenance requirements are met.

The framework for\\ndetermining fair value is based on a hierarchy  that prioritizes the inputs and valuation techniques used to\\nmeasure fair value.\\nFair values determined by Level 1 inputs use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  that the\\nCompany  has the ability  to access. \\nFair values determined by Level 2 inputs use other inputs that are observable, either directly  or indirectly .\\nThese Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets  in active markets and other inputs, such as\\ninterest rates and yield curves, that are observable at commonly  quoted intervals. All of the Company \\'s\\ninvestments are in fixed-income securities and are valued using Level 2 inputs.\\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs, including inputs that are available in situations where there is little,\\nif any , market activity  for the related asset . These Level 3 fair value measurements are based primarily  on\\nmanagem ent’s own estimates using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar\\ntechniques taking into account the characteristics of the asset .  \\n13Global Orange Development, LLC and A ffiliates\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\\nNote 7 - Fair Value Measurements  (Continued)\\nIn instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels in the above fair value\\nhierarchy , fair value measurements in their entirety  are categorized based on the lowest level input that is\\nsignificant to the valuation. The Company ’s assessment of the significance of particular inputs to these fair\\nvalue m easurements requires judgment and considers factors specific to each asset . \\nNote 8 - Related Party  Transactions\\nFollowing is a description of transactions between the Company  and related parties:\\nAccounts Receivable\\nAt December 31, 2019 , the Company  had accounts receivable from certain company  members totaling\\n$50,000 .

All Grantees are immediately\\n100 percent vested in their awarded phantom interests.\\nAs long as a Grantee is employed by the Company  at December 31 of a given fiscal year, the awards\\nprovide that the Grantees receive an annual bonus equal to the dollar amount of actual cash distributions\\nmade to a member of the Company  with respect to the Company \\'s fiscal y ear as if such member owned a\\nmembership interest in the Company  at the same percentage as the Grantee\\'s phantom interest granted\\nas of the last day  of that fiscal y ear.\\nIn the event of a payment event, which is defined as a Grantee\\'s death, termination of employment with\\nthe Company , for any  reason, or a company  change in control, the Grantee shall be entitled to pay ment in\\nsatisfaction of the phantom interests in the Company  then held by Grantee in a total amount equal to the\\nvalue of the granted phantom interests determined as of the date of such pay ment event.\\nThe Company  records a liability  for the phantom interests by determining the enterprise value of the\\nCompany , as defined by each Grantees\\' phantom interest award.

You may have to pay royalties and other \\nfees even if you are losing money. \\nBusiness model can change . The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor \\nto change its manuals and business model without your consent. These changes \\nmay require you to make additional investments in your franchise business or may \\nharm your franchise business. \\nSupplier restrictions . You may have to buy or lease items from the franchisor or a \\nlimited group of suppliers the franchisor designates. These items may be more \\nexpensive than similar items you could buy on your own. \\nOperating restrictions . The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating \\na similar business during the term of the franchise. There are usually other \\nrestrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to \\ncustomers, what you sell, how you market, and your hours of operation. \\nCompetition from franchisor . Even if the franchise agreement grants you a \\nterritory, the franchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory. \\nRenewal . Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it does, \\nyou may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order \\nto continue to operate your franchise business. \\nWhen your franchise ends. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from \\noperating a similar business after your franchise ends even if you still have \\nobligations to your landlord or other creditors. \\n \\nSome States Require Registration \\n \\nYour state may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors to \\nregister before offering or selling franchises in the state. Registration does not mean \\nthat the state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this \\ndocument. To find out if your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your \\nstate, use the agency information in Exhibit A. \\n \\nYour state also may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments \\nbe made to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the State Specific \\nAddenda. See the Table of Contents for the location of the State Specific Addenda. \\n \\n  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD  \\n59091949;2 Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise \\nCertain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted: \\n \\n1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution . The agreement requires you to \\nresolve certain disputes with the franchisor by arbitration at a location \\nchosen by the arbitrator.  Out-of-state arbitration may force you to \\naccept a less favorable settlement for disputes.  It may also cost more \\nto arbitrate with the franchisor at the location chosen by the arbitrator  \\nthan in your own state.  \\n \\n2. Negative Net Worth.  The auditor’s report on the franchisor’s \\nfinancial statements expresses substantial doubt about the \\nfranchisor’s ability to remain in business. This means that the \\nfranchisor may not have the financial resources to provide services or \\nsupport to you. \\n \\nCertain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check the “State \\nSpecific Addenda” (if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be \\nhighlighted.  \\n \\n Table of Contents  \\n \\nItem  Page \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD i  \\n59091949;2 ITEM 1 THE FRANCHISOR AND ANY PARENTS, PREDECESSORS, AND \\nAFFILIATES ............................................................................................................ 1 \\nITEM 2 BUSINESS EXPERIENCE ...................................................................................... 4 \\nITEM 3 LITIGATION ............................................................................................................ 5 \\nITEM 4 BANKRUPTCY ........................................................................................................ 5 \\nITEM 5 INITIAL FEES.......................................................................................................... 5 \\nITEM 6 OTHER FEES ......................................................................................................... 5 \\nITEM 7 ESTIMATED INITIAL INVESTMENT ....................................................................... 8 \\nITEM 8 RESTRICTIONS ON SOURCES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ..................... 10 \\nITEM 9 FRANCHISEE’S OBLIGATIONS ........................................................................... 11 \\nITEM 10 FINANCING .......................................................................................................... 12 \\nITEM 11 FRANCHISOR’S ASSISTANCE, ADVERTISING, COMPUTER SYSTEMS \\nAND TRAINING .................................................................................................... 12 \\nITEM 12 TERRITORY ......................................................................................................... 18 \\nITEM 13 TRADEMARKS ..................................................................................................... 19 \\nITEM 14 PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ....................... 20 \\nITEM 15 OBLIGATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTUAL OPERATION OF THE \\nFRANCHISE BUSINESS ...................................................................................... 21 \\nITEM 16 RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT THE FRANCHISEE MAY SELL ................................ 21 \\nITEM 17 RENEWAL, TERMINATION, TRANSFER, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION ........... 21 \\nITEM 18 PUBLIC FIGURES ................................................................................................ 25 \\nITEM 19 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPRESENTATIONS ........................................... 25 \\nITEM 20 OUTLETS AND FRANCHISEE INFORMATION .................................................... 25 \\nITEM 21 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ................................................................................... 30 \\nITEM 22 CONTRACTS ........................................................................................................ 30 \\nITEM 23 RECEIPTS ............................................................................................................ 30 \\n  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD ii 08/21  \\n59091949;2 Exhibits \\n \\nA.

Wahlburgers \\nRestaurants are contemporary and casual, with an emphasis on a colorful, fun, festive atmosphere \\nin keeping with the family spirit.  A full-service Wahlburgers Restaurant occupies approximately \\n4,500 square feet and a fast casual Wahlburgers Restaurant occupies approximately 1,800 - 2,200 \\nsquare feet.  A full-service Wahlburgers Restaurant includes a full bar, subject to license \\navailability. \\nWahlburgers Restaurants operate according to a unique and distinctive system (“System”), \\nwhose distinguishing characteristics include our décor, layout, color schemes, and designs \\n(collectively, “Trade Dress”); our menu items, recipes and food preparation and service techniques; \\nour standards and specifications for equipment, equipment layouts, and interior and exterior \\naccessories; and the accumulated experience reflected in our training program, operating \\nprocedures, and standards and specifications.  \\nWe describe our mandatory and recommended standards, specifications, and operating \\nprocedures in our confidential operating manuals (“Manual”).  We will loan one copy of, or provide \\nelectronic access to, the Manual for the term of the Master Franchise Agreement.  We may \\nperiodically change, improve, add to, and further develop the Manual and the elements of the \\nSystem. \\nWahlburgers Master Franchise \\nWe are offering, under the terms of this disclosure document, the opportunity to become a  \\nWahlburgers master franchisee.  As a Wahlburgers master franchisee, you will grant licenses to \\nsubfranchisees (\"Subfranchisees\") within a designated development territory (\"Development \\nTerritory\") for the right to develop and operate Wahlburgers Restaurants and you will support those \\nSubfranchisees and their subfranchised Wahlburgers Restaurants (\"Subfranchised Restaurant(s)\") \\npursuant to the terms of a subfranchise agreement between the Subfranchisee you. \\nIf we grant you the right to become a Wahlburgers master franchisee, you will execute our \\nmaster franchise agreement, attached as Exhibit C to this disclosure document (\"Master Franchise \\nAgreement\"), and will be granted the right and obligation to have open and operating a mutually \\nagreed upon number of Subfranchised Restaurants in the Development Territory in accordance \\nwith a mutually agreed upon schedule (\"Development Schedule\").  For each subfranchise that you \\ngrant for the operation of a Subfranchised Restaurant, you must utilize and execute our then-\\ncurrent standard form of subfranchise agreement, as we may prescribe and amend from time to \\ntime (\"Subfranchise Agreement\").  Our current form of Subfranchise Agreement is attached as \\nExhibit 2 to the Master Franchise Agreement. \\nPrior to executing a Subfranchise Agreement for a Subfranchised Restaurant, you will:  (a) \\nscreen the prospective Subfranchisee to verify that the prospective Subfranchisee meets all criteria \\nfor Subfranchisees pursuant to a franchise marketing strategy you develop and we approve or as \\nwe otherwise require periodically; (b) submit to us a complete report (containing that information \\nwe reasonably require) for the prospective Subfranchisee; and (c) obtain our written consent to the \\nprospective Subfranchisee and the proposed site at which the prospective Subfranchisee will  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD 3 08/21  \\n59091949;2 operate its Subfranchised Restaurant.  Unless we grant our prior written approval otherwise, all \\nSubfranchised Restaurants must be full-service restaurants. In addition, our prior written consent is \\nrequired before a Subfranchisee can relocate or cease operations at a Subfranchised Restaurant. \\nAs a Wahlburgers master franchisee, you will be required to conduct our initial training \\nprogram for your Subfranchisees, prepare and implement an approved franchise services program, \\nconduct ongoing inspections, evaluations and consultation services with respect to all \\nSubfranchised Restaurants and perform such other services for your Subfranchisees and their \\nSubfranchised Restaurants as set forth in more detail in the Master Franchise Agreement and the \\nSubfranchise Agreement. \\nThis disclosure document offers a franchise only for the right to operate as a Wahlburgers \\nmaster franchisee. Under a separate disclosure document, we also offer the right to develop, open \\nand operate individual Wahlburgers Restaurants.  Under this disclosure document, you obtain no \\nright to develop, open or operate a Wahlburgers Restaurant and we are not making any offer of a \\nWahlburgers Restaurant unit franchise under this disclosure document. \\nMarket and Competition \\nThe market for gourmet burger restaurants is well-developed and is not seasonal.  You and \\nyour subfranchisees will compete with other national and regional gourmet burger restaurant \\nbrands as well as other franchised, chain or independent restaurants.  Some of our competitors \\nhave longer operating histories than ours.  The restaurant business is highly competitive based on \\nprice, service, restaurant location and food quality and is subject to fluctuations in consumer tastes, \\neconomic conditions, population, and traffic patterns.  The ability of each Subfranchised \\nRestaurant to compete depends on location, ingress and egress, signage, parking, service, ability \\nto attract and maintain highly motivated employees, overhead, changing local market and \\neconomic conditions, and many other factors both within and outside your control. \\nAlthough we carefully evaluate persons who wish to become our master franchisees, no \\nscreening process that we implement can conclusively determine whether you will succeed as a \\nWahlburgers master franchisee.  Similarly, completion of our training program does not provide any \\nassurance of success.  You must rely on your own assessment of your suitability (in terms of \\nenergy, business skill, desire, temperament, people skills, and financial capability, among other \\nthings) and your own advisors. \\nIndustry-Specific Laws \\nBecause you will be offering and selling subfranchises, you will need to comply with the \\nfederal, state and local laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offer and sale of subfranchises. \\nAs such, you will prepare (and amend as necessary) a subfranchise disclosure document in \\ncompliance with federal and state laws, rules and regulations, and be subject to certain disclosure \\nrequirements to prospective subfranchisees. In certain states, you will be required to register the \\nsubfranchise offering with the applicable state agency prior to the offer and sale of these \\nsubfranchises. You may not offer or sell subfranchises in these states until you have an effective \\nregistration.  Further, some states also have franchise relationship laws with which you may have \\nto comply that impact the default, termination, transfer and renewal of subfranchises. You are \\nexclusively responsible for compliance with all federal and state franchise and business opportunity \\nlaws, and the payment of all registration and filing fees, and all associated attorney fees. We \\nrecommend that you obtain the services of a franchise attorney in order to comply with all \\napplicable franchise and business opportunity registration and disclosure laws.  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD 4 08/21  \\n59091949;2 In addition, you must comply with all local, state and federal laws and regulations applicable \\nto the operation of a business generally (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act) with which \\nyou must comply. You should consult with your attorney concerning all laws and regulations that \\nmay affect your business.  \\nITEM 2 \\n \\nBUSINESS EXPERIENCE \\nManager:  Wahlburgers Holding Company LLC (“WB Holding”) \\n As stated in Item 1, our sole member is WB Holding.

This estimate includes costs such a phone system, \\ndesks, other office furniture, filing cabinets and related office supplies. The costs for \\nfurniture and fixtures may differ depending on the material quality and on other factors. It is \\nassumed that some of the equipment will be leased. If you elect to purchase such \\nequipment, your costs may be higher. \\n(3) If you do not already have one available for your use as a Wahlburgers master franchisee, \\nyou must purchase and utilize a computer hardware, software, internet connections and \\nservice, required dedicated telephone and power lines and other computer-related \\naccessories, peripherals and equipment (\"Computer System”). While we reserve the right to \\nmandate the make and model for your Computer System, we do not currently do so.  You \\nmust obtain high-speed communications access for your Computer System. You also agree \\nto maintain a functioning e-mail address for your Wahlburgers master franchise business. \\nThe cost of the Computer System that you will be required to purchase varies depending on \\nyour number of employees that you hire. \\n(4) As described in Item 11, prior to the opening of the first Subfranchised Restaurant \\ndeveloped pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement, the number of trainers we specify \\nmust attend our initial Wahlburgers initial training program.  We do not charge tuition for this \\ntraining program, but you are responsible for all salaries, benefits, and travel, living, and \\nother expenses incurred by you and your employees while attending the training.  The cost \\nof these expenses will depend on the distance you must travel, the types of \\naccommodations, the number of your employees attending training, and their wages.  \\n(5)     We recommend strongly that you engage the services of professionals to assist you in \\nevaluating our master franchise and to help you establish your business. This will include \\nattorneys and accountants. Actual cost depends on the work done by your attorneys and \\naccountants and their rates. \\n(6) This range varies based on the number of states in which the subfranchise offering is \\nregistered. \\n(7) This is our estimate of your operating expenses for the initial 3 months of your business, \\nincluding payroll costs for management, rent, insurance, and utilities.  These expenses do \\nnot include advertising or royalty payments made to us.  The estimate also does not take \\ninto account revenue you may take in.  These figures are estimates, and we cannot \\nguarantee that you will not have additional expenses starting the business.  Your actual \\ncosts will depend on factors such as how closely you follow our methods and procedures; \\nyour management skill, experience and business acumen; financing costs; local economic \\nconditions; the prevailing wage rate; competition in the market place; and the sales level \\nreached during the initial period.  \\n(8) We relied on our and our affiliates\\' experience offering to compile these estimates.  You \\nshould review these figures carefully with a business advisor before making any decision to \\npurchase a master franchise.  We do not offer financing directly or indirectly for any part of \\nthe initial investment.  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD 10 08/21  \\n59091949;2 ITEM 8 \\n \\nRESTRICTIONS ON SOURCES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES \\nSupplier Approval Process \\nWe have the right to require that all food and non-food products (including, but not limited \\nto, Branded Merchandise), supplies, equipment and services that you and your Subfranchisees \\npurchase for use, sale or resale: (a) meet specifications that we establish from time to time; (b) be \\npurchased only from suppliers that we have consented to (which may include us and/or our \\naffiliates); and/or (c) be purchased only from a single source or from a limited number of \\ndesignated sources (which may include us and/or our affiliates).  To the extent that we establish \\nspecifications, require our consent to suppliers or designate specific suppliers for particular items, \\nwe will publish our requirements in the Manual or otherwise in writing (which includes electronic \\npublication). \\nWe have developed and may continue to develop certain proprietary food products that will \\nbe prepared by or for us according to our proprietary special recipes and formulas.  You must \\nrequire your Subfranchisees to purchase and use those food products developed by us pursuant to \\na special recipe or formula only from us, our affiliates or a third party designated and licensed by \\nus to prepare and sell such products.  We may create purchasing restrictions to control the quality \\nand selection, and ensure the consistency, of menu items, ingredients, Branded Merchandise and \\nother merchandise; to consolidate System purchases to reduce costs or ensure availability of \\nproducts; or for other valid business reasons. \\nBranded Merchandise currently must be purchased exclusively from Stran Promotional \\nSolutions (“Stran”).  During fiscal year 2020, the total amount received from Stran from franchisee \\npurchases of Branded Merchandise was $12,657.65.  This represents 0.3% of our total 2020 \\nrevenues of $4,058,886. \\nYou may not, and  must ensure that your Subfranchisees do not, engage in “grey market” \\nactivities in which you take advantage of any group purchasing arrangements for Wahlburgers \\nRestaurants to purchase products that are then resold to purchasers outside of the System or use \\nin a business outside of the System. \\nAs of the issuance date of this disclosure document, neither we nor any of our affiliates are \\napproved suppliers for any product.  We and our affiliates may earn income on sales of products \\n(including, but not limited to, Branded Merchandise), ingredients, and/or supplies to you.  We may \\nreceive rebates, commissions, or other payments from third-party suppliers based on your \\npurchases from them.  As of the issuance date of this disclosure document, however, except with \\nrespect to Branded Merchandise (as detailed above), such rebates, commissions, or other \\npayments are returned to franchisees and/or contributed to the Brand Fund.  You agree that we \\nare entitled to retain such income and consideration. \\nAs noted above, Branded Merchandise must be purchased from us or a source designated \\nby us.  If you would like to purchase other products or services from a supplier to which we have \\nnot consented, you must submit a written request for consent.  Criteria for approving proposed \\nsuppliers will be made available to you on your request.  We have the right to inspect the proposed \\nsupplier’s facilities and test samples of the proposed products.  You agree to pay to us a \\nreasonable fee, not to exceed the actual cost of the inspection and testing the proposed product or \\nevaluating the proposed supplier, including personnel and travel costs, whether or not the product \\nor supplier is accepted.  We have the right to grant, deny or revoke consent to products, services  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD 11 08/21  \\n59091949;2 and suppliers in our sole discretion.  We will notify you of our decision as soon as practicable \\nfollowing our evaluation, not to exceed 90 days.  If approval is obtained, you may contract with the \\naccepted supplier.  We reserve the right to reinspect the facilities and products of any accepted \\nsupplier and revoke acceptance in writing upon the supplier’s failure to meet any of our then-\\ncurrent criteria. \\nWe estimate that the purchase of products from us, our affiliates, or our approved or \\ndesignated suppliers and/or products that are subject to our standards and specifications \\nrepresents approximately 1-5% of your overall purchases in establishing a Wahlburgers master \\nfranchise business and 1-5% of your overall purchases in operating as a Wahlburgers master \\nfranchisee. \\nCurrently, we do not provide material benefits to you based on your use of approved or \\ndesignated suppliers.  As of the issuance date of this disclosure document, we have negotiated \\nsystem-wide purchasing arrangements, including pricing terms, with Sysco, Coca-Cola, Ecolab, \\nStran, Wolverine, Turano, FireKing and Lamb Wesson to maximize the combined purchasing \\npower benefit of all Wahlburgers Restaurants.  We do not currently have purchasing or distribution \\ncooperatives, but we reserve the right to establish them. \\nThere are no approved suppliers in which any of our officers own an interest. \\nComputer System \\nSee Item 11 for information regarding our current minimum standards for the Computer \\nSystem for your master franchise business and your related obligations under the Master \\nFranchised Agreement. \\nInsurance \\nDuring the term of the Master Franchise Agreement, you must maintain in full force and \\neffect such insurance, with such minimum liability coverages, as we may periodically determine to \\nbe necessary or appropriate to cover all existing, anticipated or threatened difference, claim \\ncontroversy, case, suit, action, proceeding, dispute, demand, cause of action, complaint, defense, \\naffirmative defense, counterclaim, impleader, interpleader, third party or derivative claim, class \\naction, investigation, petition for legal, equitable or declarative relief, inquiry, whether formal or \\ninformal, or other claim arising out of, in connection with or in relation to the Master Franchise \\nAgreement, any Subfranchise Agreement or any related agreement. \\nITEM 9 \\n \\nFRANCHISEE’S OBLIGATIONS \\nThis table lists your principal obligations under the Master Franchise Agreement.

Provide you prototypical plans and specifications for a Wahlburgers Restaurant.  \\n(Master Franchise Agreement §6.1) \\n2. Loan you one copy of, or provide you with electronic access to, the Manual, which \\ncontains detailed information related to the Wahlburgers System, Wahlburgers Restaurants and/or \\nthe Proprietary Marks.  You may keep the Manual for as long as the Master Franchise Agreement \\nremains in effect, but the Manual remains our property.  We may revise the contents of the Manual, \\nand you agree to comply with each new or changed section.  (Master Franchise Agreement § 6.1).  \\nWe will permit you to inspect a copy of the Manual at our offices before you purchase a franchise, \\nif you first sign a Confidentiality Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit D. \\n3. Advise you in writing whether we have approved your plan to sell and offer for sale \\nto Subfranchisees licenses to develop, open and operate Subfranchised Restaurants in the \\nDevelopment Territory (\"Franchise Marketing Strategy\"), which Franchise Marketing Strategy you \\nmust submit to us within 60 days after the Effective Date of the Master Franchise Agreement. \\n(Master Franchise Agreement § 11.2)  \\nOur Obligations After Opening \\nDuring your operation as a Wahlburgers master franchisee, we will: \\n1. Advise you in writing whether we have approved your program to support \\nSubfranchisees, which includes initial and continuing services, identify sources of approved \\nequipment and supplies, set up periodic communications with Subfranchisees and perform periodic \\ninspections of Subfranchised Restaurants to determine compliance with the Subfranchise \\nAgreements. (\"Franchise Services Program\"), which Franchise Services Program you must submit \\nto us by at least 60 days before the opening date of the first Subfranchised Restaurant. (Master \\nFranchise Agreement § 11.2)   \\n2. Advise you in writing whether we have approved prospective Subfranchisee \\ncandidates that you propose (Master Franchise Agreement § 11.3)   \\n3. Advise you in writing whether we have accepted sites for Subfranchised \\nRestaurants that you propose to us within 30 days after we receive a complete site review report \\n(as determined by us).   \\n4. Collect, administer, and spend for advertising purposes monies paid by master \\nfranchisees, unit franchisees and company-operated Wahlburgers Restaurants into the Brand \\nFund as described below.  (Master Franchise Agreement § 8.1 ) \\n5. Periodically change the System, including modifications to the Manual, the menu, \\nthe required equipment, the signage, the Proprietary Marks, and the Trade Dress.  You must \\ncomply, and require your Subfranchisees to comply, with any such System changes and make \\nsuch expenditures as the System changes require.  We also have the right to vary System \\nstandards, in our reasonable judgment, to accommodate circumstances of individual franchisees.  \\n(Master Franchise Agreement § 6.2)   \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD 14 08/21  \\n59091949;2 6. Prior to the opening of the first Subfranchised Restaurant developed under the \\nMaster Franchise Agreement, we will provide the Wahlburgers initial training program to your \\ntrainers. (Master Franchise Agreement § 9.1) \\n7. Provide additional ongoing training to your training personnel at the times and \\nlocations that we designate.  (Master Franchise Agreement § 9.1)  \\n 8 . Provide the assistance that we consider to be reasonably necessary to assist you in \\nestablishing a training facility at which you will offer the Wahlburgers initial training program.  The \\ntraining facility must be certified by us before you commence any training at the training facility, \\nand we may periodically visit and evaluate the training facility and your trainers to ensure that they \\ncontinue to meet our standards.  We may revoke our certification of the training facility if the \\ntraining facility or your trainers cease to meet our standards.  (Master Franchise Agreement § 9.2) \\nBrand Fund and Marketing \\nBrand Fund.   We have established a Brand Fund to which each Subfranchisee must \\ncontribute 0.50% of its Fiscal Period Gross Sales.  There currently is no franchisee advertising \\ncouncil that advises us on advertising policy. \\nWe may use the Brand Fund contributions and any earnings of the Brand Fund for any \\ncosts associated with advertising, marketing, public relations, promotional programs and materials \\n(which may be national, regional or local in scope) and/or any other activities that we believe would \\nbenefit the System, including the following: advertising campaigns in various media; point-of-\\npurchase materials; review of locally-produced ads; free standing inserts; brochures; purchasing \\nand/or developing promotional materials; market research, including secret shoppers; \\nsponsorships; design and maintenance of a web site; celebrity endorsements; trade shows; \\nassociation dues; search engine optimization costs; establishment of a third party facility for \\ncustomizing local advertising; accounting costs; and holding an annual franchise convention.  We \\nwill not use the Brand Fund for any activity whose sole purpose is the marketing of franchises or \\nthe soliciting of franchisees; however, you acknowledge that the Wahlburgers web site, public \\nrelations activities, community involvement activities, and other activities that may be supported by \\nthe Brand Fund may contain information about franchising opportunities.  We have the right to \\ndirect all programs supported by the Brand Fund, with final discretion over creative concepts, the \\nmaterials and media used in the programs, and their placement.  We may work with our in-house \\nadvertising department and/or a regional advertising agency to develop advertising for print and \\nradio.  We do not guarantee that you will benefit from the Brand Fund in proportion to your \\ncontributions to the Brand Fund.  In spending advertising monies, we will not be obligated to make \\nexpenditures for any franchisee or subfranchisee that are equivalent or proportionate to that \\nfranchisee’s or subfranchisee;s contribution or to ensure that any particular franchisee or \\nsubfranchisee benefits directly or on a pro rata basis from expenditures of the funds.  We likewise \\nwill not be obligated to spend any amount on advertising in the area of territory in which you or \\nyour Subfranchisees are located.  You must participate in all advertising, marketing, promotions, \\nresearch, and public relations programs instituted by the Brand Fund. \\nWe will not use any contributions to the Brand Fund to defray any of our general operating \\nexpenses, except for reasonable administrative costs and overhead that we incur in activities \\nreasonably related to the administration of the Brand Fund or the management of Brand Fund-\\nsupported programs (including salaries of our personnel who devote time to Brand Fund activities).  \\nWe will separately account for the Brand Fund, but we do not need to segregate Brand Fund \\nmonies from our other monies.  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD 15 08/21  \\n59091949;2 Any point-of-sale materials produced with Brand Fund monies will be made available to you \\nat a reasonable cost, and the proceeds of such sales will be credited to the Brand Fund.  We are \\nnot required to have an independent audit of the Brand Fund completed.  We will make available \\nan unaudited statement of contributions and expenditures for the Brand Fund no sooner than 90 \\ndays after the close of our fiscal year to franchisees who make a written request for a copy.  \\nWahlburgers Restaurants owned by us and/or our affiliates will contribute to the Brand Fund on the \\nsame basis as comparable franchisees.  If we reduce the Brand Fund Contribution for comparable \\nfranchisees, we will have the right to reduce by the same amount the required contribution for \\nWahlburgers Restaurants operated by us or our affiliates. \\nIn our last fiscal year, of the total monies spent by the Brand Fund,  approximately 44% was \\nspent on digital; approximately 15% was spent on brand strategy; approximately 9% was spent on \\ncreative development; approximately 8% was spent on quarterly national programs; approximately \\n6% was spent on new store opening support; approximately 2% was spent on website \\ndevelopment and approximately 16% was spent on miscellaneous expenses, including \\nconsultants, legal fees, MIRA Subscription and Chatmeter.  No money was spent by the Brand \\nFund to solicit new franchisees. \\n \\nWe may spend in any fiscal year an amount greater or less than the aggregate contribution \\nof Wahlburgers Restaurants to the Brand Fund, generally, we believe that we will spend all \\nadvertising payments during the taxable year in which the contribution and earnings are received.  \\nIf we do not spend the advertising payments in one year, we will likely spend them in the following \\nyear or distribute any surplus to then-current franchisees who contribute to the applicable Fund \\nand restaurants operated by us or our affiliates. \\nLocal Marketing.  You must, at all times throughout the term of the Master Franchise \\nAgreement, use your best efforts to advance the reputation of Wahlburgers Restaurants and the \\nproducts sold under the Proprietary Marks and to develop awareness of Wahlburgers Restaurants \\namong consumers in order to increase the goodwill of the Proprietary Marks and the System.  Prior \\nto use, you must submit all advertising materials to us for our approval, which approval will not be \\nunreasonably withheld. \\nPoint-of-Sale Materials.   If we develop any point-of- sales materials, we may offer to sell \\nthose to you at a reasonable cost. \\nSocial Media.   We may establish a \"Social Media\" policy (defined as any form of electronic \\ncommunications, including Internet web sites, social networking sites, applications or other future \\ntechnological avenues that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social \\nnetworking), and you must comply with any such Social Media policy, as modified periodically, and \\nany additional policies that we issue.  Any copyright in your sites or pages on any Social Media are \\nowned by us, and you must sign any documents that we reasonably deem necessary to affirm our \\nownership of the copyright. \\nPublic and Media Relations.   You may not issue any press or other media releases or \\nother communications without our prior consent.  As a master franchisee of the System, you may \\nonly participate in internal and external communications activities that create goodwill, enhance our \\npublic image, and build the Wahlburgers brand. \\nComputer System \\nIf you do not already have one available for use as a Wahlburgers master franchisee, you \\nmust purchase and utilize a Computer System. While we reserve the right to mandate the make  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD 16 08/21  \\n59091949;2 and model for your Computer System, we do not currently do so. You must obtain high-speed \\ncommunications access for your Computer System. You also agree to maintain a functioning e-\\nmail address for your Wahlburgers master franchise business. If you do not have a suitable \\nComputer System, it may cost you up to $5,000 to acquire a suitable Computer System. \\nWe will have independent access to the information and data on the Computer System, and \\nthere are no contractual limitations on our right to access that information.  Neither we, our \\naffiliates, nor any third parties are required to provide ongoing maintenance, repairs, upgrades, or \\nupdates to your Computer System.  Currently, there are no optional or required \\nmaintenance/upgrade contracts for your Computer System.  We estimate that the annual cost of \\noptional or required maintenance, upgrades, or updates for your Computer System is \\napproximately $1,000 - $3,000. \\nTypical Time Between Agreement Signing and Opening \\nWe estimate that there will be an interval of 90 to 180 days between the signing of the \\nMaster Franchise Agreement and you beginning to act as master franchisee.  You may not begin \\nacting as master franchisee until you have complied with all franchise registration and disclosure \\nrequirements. \\nTraining \\nITP.  Prior to the opening of the first Subfranchised Restaurant developed pursuant to the \\nMaster Franchise Agreement, your trainers must attend and successfully complete the \\nWahlburgers initial training program (\"ITP\").  The length of the ITP is 2 weeks.  We offer the ITP \\nduring the year on an as-needed basis.  Until you have established a training facility, we will \\nprovide your employees and you the ITP at locations we determine periodically, including a \\nWahlburgers Restaurant operated by our affiliates and/or our corporate office, which is currently in \\nHingham, Massachusetts. \\nThe initial training must be completed before any trainer provides training to your \\nemployees, Subfranchisees or any other person and before any Subfranchised Restaurant opens. \\nUpon our request, as a prerequisite to the ITP, your trainers must successfully complete (as we \\ndetermine in our sole discretion), at your cost, a ServSafe food safety training and certification \\nprogram administered by the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation.  Any \\nreplacement employees who are required to attend the ITP, may do so, subject to space \\navailability and your payment of a training fee.  You must pay all salaries, benefits, travel, living, \\nand other expenses incurred by your employees while attending the training.  We have the right to \\ndismiss from the ITP any person whom we believe will not perform acceptably in the position for \\nwhich he/she has been hired, and you must provide a suitable replacement within 30 days of \\ndismissal.  If you or your trainers fail to complete the ITP to our satisfaction, we may terminate the \\nMaster Franchise Agreement or permit you or your trainers to repeat the ITP at the next available \\nscheduled training session.  We reserve the right to charge a training fee if you or your trainers are \\nrequired to repeat the ITP. \\nOur Director of Training & Franchise Support, Caitlin Clair, is currently responsible for the \\ntraining program.  Ms. Clair has approximately 10 years of experience in food and beverage \\nservices and 9 years of experience in training.  She became Director of Training & Franchise \\nSupport in November 2020.  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise FDD 17 08/21  \\n59091949;2 The following chart summarizes the subjects taught during ITP: \\nTRAINING PROGRAM \\n \\nSUBJECT  HOURS OF \\nCLASSROOM \\nTRAINING  HOURS OF \\nON-THE-JOB \\nTRAINING  LOCATION  \\nGeneral \\nManagement/  \\nConcept/Culture  5.25 0 Our corporate office which is \\ncurrently located in Hingham, \\nMassachusetts or an affiliate-owned \\nWahlburgers Restaurant  \\nFront of the House  0 16 An affiliate-owned Wahlburgers \\nRestaurant  \\nBack of the House  0 16 An affiliate-owned Wahlburgers \\nRestaurant  \\nShadow Manager \\non Duty 0 47.75 An affiliate-owned Wahlburgers \\nRestaurant  \\n  \\nTraining by Master Franchisee and Certification of Your Training Facility.

The Parties acknowledge that Subfranchised \\nRestaurants to be developed by Subfranchisees pursuant to this Agreement are intended to be full \\nservice format restaurants.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Master Franchisee believes that \\nparticular Subfranchised Restaurant(s) would be better suited to operate as a smaller, counter-\\nservice style format restaurant(s), Master Franchisee may submit to Wahlburgers a Site \\nAcceptance Request (subject to the procedures specified in Section 10) for each proposed site \\nrequesting approval to grant a subfranchise for that alternative format. Wahlburgers may withhold \\nits approval if it determines, in its commercially reasonable discretion, that the alternative format \\nwould not be in the best interests of the Wahlburgers System or the Wahlburgers brand. \\n2.3 Limitation on Rights Granted. \\n(a) Subfranchise Rights Only.

Each Subfranchised Restaurant \\ndeveloped pursuant to this Agreement will be opened and operated only in Full Compliance with a \\nseparate Subfranchise Agreement, regardless of whether the Subfranchisee or the Subfranchised \\nRestaurant is owned in whole or in part by Master Franchisee or an Unaffiliated Subfranchisee. \\n(b) Wahlburgers System Only.   The rights granted to Master Franchisee under \\nthis Agreement relate exclusively to the Wahlburgers System.

Wahlburgers will have the right to modify or \\nterminate Master Franchisee’s limited exclusive rights in the Development Territory in accordance \\nwith Section 18.1 as an alternative to terminating the Development Term pursuant to that Section. \\n2.4 Forms of Agreement.

The decision as to whether to \\nconsent to a Transfer will be made in the exercise of our business judgment, but our consent will \\nnot be unreasonably withheld.

Wahlburgers\\' or our waiver of a default by another \\nfranchisee does not affect or impair our right to demand your strict compliance with the terms of \\nthis Agreement.  Wahlburgers\\' or our acceptance of any payments due from you does not waive \\nany prior defaults. \\n22.3 No Warranties.  Neither Wahlburgers nor we make any warranties or guarantees \\nupon which you may rely by providing any waiver, approval, consent or suggestion to you in \\nconnection with this Agreement and assume no liability or obligation to you therefor, or by reason \\nof any neglect, delay, or denial of any request therefor.

The following statements are added to Item \\n17.h.: \\nPursuant to Section 13.1-564 of the Virginia Retail Franchising Act, it is unlawful for a \\nfranchisor to cancel a franchise without reasonable cause.  If any ground for default or \\ntermination stated in the Development Agreement and/or Franchise Agreement does not \\nconstitute “reasonable cause,” as that term may be defined in the Virginia Retail \\nFranchising Act or the laws of Virginia, that provision may not be enforceable. \\nPursuant to Section 13.1-564 of the Virginia Retail Franchising Act, it is unlawful for a \\nfranchisor to use undue influence to induce a franchisee to surrender any right given to \\nhim under the franchise.  If any provision of the Development Agreement and/or \\nFranchise Agreement involves the use of undue influence by the franchisor to induce a \\nfranchisee to surrender any rights given to him under the franchise, that provision may \\nnot be enforceable. \\nEach provision of these Additional Disclosures shall be effective only to the extent, with respect \\nto such provision, that the jurisdictional requirements of the Virginia Retail Franchising Act are \\nmet independently without reference to these Additional Disclosures.  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise       08/21 - WA \\n59191874;3 ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES AND ADDENDA REQUIRED BY \\n \\nTHE STATE OF WASHINGTON \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise       08/21 - WA \\n59191874;3 ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES \\nREQUIRED BY THE STATE OF WASHINGTON \\n1.

The following risk factors are added to the State Cover Sheet: \\nTHE FRANCHISOR HAS A LIMITED FRANCHISE OPERATING HISTORY TO ASSIST \\nA PROSPECTIVE FRANCHISEE IN DECIDING TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT. \\nTHE FRANCHISOR HAS LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHICH MIGHT NOT BE \\nADEQUATE TO FUND ITS PRE-OPENING OBLIGATIONS TO EACH FRANCHISEE \\nAND PAY OPERATING EXPENSES. \\nEach provision of these Additional Disclosures shall be effective only to the extent, with respect \\nto such provision, that the jurisdictional requirements of the Washington Franchise Investment \\nProtection Act are met independently without reference to these Additional Disclosures. \\n  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise   08/21 - WA \\n59191874;3 ADDENDUM TO THE \\nWAHLBURGERS RESTAURANT MASTER FRANCHISE AGREEMENT \\nREQUIRED BY THE STATE OF WASHINGTON \\nThis Addendum to the Wahlburgers Restaurant Master Franchise Agreement dated \\n__________________ (“Master Franchise Agreement”) between Wahlburgers Franchising LLC \\n(“Wahlburgers,” “we” or “us”) and _________________________________________ (“Master \\nFranchisee,” “you” or “your”) is entered into simultaneously with the execution of the Master \\nFranchise Agreement. \\nIn the event of a conflict of laws, the provisions of the Washington Franchise Investment \\nProtection Act, Chapter 19.100 RCW will prevail.  \\n1. RCW 19.100.180 may supersede the master franchise agreement in your relationship \\nwith the franchisor including the areas of termination and renewal of your franchise. \\nThere may also be court decisions which may supersede the area development \\nagreement in your relationship with the franchisor including the areas of termination and \\nrenewal of your franchise.  \\n2. In any arbitration or mediation involving a franchise purchased in Washington, the \\narbitration or mediation site will be either in the state of Washington, or in a place \\nmutually agreed upon at the time of the arbitration or mediation, or as determined by the \\narbitrator or mediator at the time of arbitration or mediation. In addition, if litigation is not \\nprecluded by the area development agreement, an area developer may bring an action \\nor proceeding arising out of or in connection with the sale of franchises, or a violation of \\nthe Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act, in Washington.  \\n3. A release or waiver of rights executed by an area developer may not include rights under \\nthe Washington Franchise Investment Protection Act or any rule or order thereunder \\nexcept when executed pursuant to a negotiated settlement after the agreement is in \\neffect and where the parties are represented by independent counsel. Provisions such \\nas those which unreasonably restrict or limit the statute of limitations period for claims \\nunder the Act, or rights or remedies under the Act such as a right to a jury trial, may not \\nbe enforceable.  \\n4. Transfer fees are collectable to the extent that they reflect the franchisor’s reasonable \\nestimated or actual costs in effecting a transfer.  \\n5. Pursuant to RCW 49.62.020, a noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable \\nagainst an employee, including an employee of a franchisee, unless the employee’s \\nearnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $100,000 per \\nyear (an amount that will be adjusted annually for inflation). In addition, a noncompetition \\ncovenant is void and unenforceable against an independent contractor of a franchisee \\nunder RCW 49.62.030 unless the independent contractor’s earnings from the party \\nseeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed $250,000 per year (an amount that will \\nbe adjusted annually for inflation). As a result, any provisions contained in the area \\ndevelopment agreement or elsewhere that conflict with these limitations are void and \\nunenforceable in Washington.  \\nRCW 49.62.060 prohibits a franchisor from restricting, restraining, or prohibiting an area \\ndeveloper from (i) soliciting or hiring any employee of an area developer of the same franchisor  \\n \\nWahlburgers Tribal Casino Master Franchise  2 08/21 - WA \\n59191874;3 or (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee of the franchisor.

If the \\ndeficiency is rectified within 60 days, the notice will be void.  These notice \\nrequirements shall not apply if the reason for termination, cancellation or \\nnonrenewal is insolvency, the occurrence of an assignment for the benefit of \\ncreditors or bankruptcy.  If the reason for termination, cancellation, \\nnonrenewal or substantial change in competitive circumstances is \\nnonpayment of sums due under the franchise, Franchisee will be entitled to \\nwritten notice of such default, and will have not less than 10 days in which to \\nremedy such default from the date of delivery or posting of such notice. \\n  \\n 2.

The \\npurchase price for assets will not include any factor or increment for any tradem ark or other \\ncommercial symbol used in the business, the value of any intangible assets, or any goodwill or \\n“going concern” value for the Business.

It will not be necessary \\nfor Lender, in order to enforce the payment or performance by Guarantor, first to institute suit or \\nexhaust its remedies against Borrower or others liable on the Indebtedness or for the perfo rmance,  \\nto enforce  its rights  against  any security  that will ever have been given  to secure  the Indebtedness  \\nor performance,  to join Borrower  or any others  liable  on the Guaranteed  Obligation in any action \\nto enforce this Guaranty, or to resort to any other means of obtaining payment or performance  \\nof the Guaranteed  Obligation.  Suit may be brought  or demand  may be made  against all parties who \\nhave signed this Guaranty, or against any one or more of them, separately or together, without \\nimpairing the rig hts of Lender against any other party to this Guaranty. At any time Lender is \\nentitled to exercise its remedies under this Guaranty, Lender may in its sole discretion elect to \\ndemand payment or performance. If Lender elects to demand performance, it will a t all times have \\nthe right to demand payment until all of the Indebtedness has been paid in full.  If Lender  elects  to \\ndemand  payment,  it will at all times  have the right to demand  performance until all of the \\nIndebtedness has been paid in  full. \\n4. Certain Agreements and Waivers by Guarantor.  Guarantor agrees that neither Lender’s \\nrights  and remedies  nor Guarantor’s  obligations  under  the terms  of this Guaranty  will be released, \\ndiminished, impaired, reduced, or affected by any one or more of the  following:  \\n \\n(a) Any limitation of liability or recourse in any other Loan  Document.  \\n \\n(b) The taking or accepting of any other security or guaranty for, or right of recourse \\nwith respect to, any or all of the Guaranteed  Obligation.  \\n \\n(c) Any release, surrender, exchange, subordination, deterioration, waste, impairment, \\nor loss of, or any failure  to create  or perfect,  any lien or security  interest  with respect  to any security \\nat any time existing or purported, believed, or expected to exist in connection with any or all of \\nthe Guaranteed  Obligation.  \\n \\n(d) Any partial release of the liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty, or if there is \\nmore than one person signing this Guaranty, the complete or partial release of any one or more \\nof them.  \\n(e) The death, insolvency, bankruptcy, disability, dissolution, liquidation, termination, \\nreceivership, reorganization, change of form or name, structure, or ownership, sale of all assets, \\nor lack of corporate,  partnership,  or other  power  of Borrower,  any of the undersigned,  or any  \\n6 \\n2019 Bloomin’ Blinds FDD   General Release  \\n party  at any time liable  for the payment  or performance  of any or all of the Guaranteed  Obligation, \\nwhether now existing or later  occurring.  \\n \\n(f) The renewal, extension, modification, or rearrangement of the payment or \\nperformance of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligation, either with or without notice to or the \\nconsent of Guarantor, or any adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, or compromise that ma y be \\ngranted or given by Lender to Borrower or Guarantor from time to  time.  \\n \\n(g) Any neglect, delay, omission, failure, or refusal of Lender to take or prosecute any \\naction for the collection or enforcement of any of the Guaranteed Obligation or to foreclose or \\ntake or prosecute  any action  to foreclose  on any security  for the Guaranteed  Obligation  or to take \\nor prosecute any action in connection with any Loan  Document.  \\n \\n(h) Lender’s failure to notify Guarantor of any creation, renewal, extension, \\nrearrangement, modification, or assignment of the Guaranteed Obligation or any part of it, or of \\nany Loan  Document,  or of any release  of or change  in any security  or of any other  action  taken  or \\nrefrained  from  being  taken  by Lender  against  Borrower  or any security  or other  recourse  or of any \\nnew agreement between Lender and Borrower, it being understood that Lender will not be required \\nto give Guarantor any notice of any kind under any circumstances with respect to or in connection \\nwith the Guaranteed  Obligation.  \\n \\n(i) The unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligation against \\nBorrower, whether because the Guaranteed Obligation exceeds the amount permitted by law or \\nviolates  any usury  law, the act of creating  the Guaranteed  Obligation  or any part of it is ultra vires, \\nthe officers or persons creating the Guaranteed Obligation acted in excess of their authority, \\nBorrower has any valid defense, claim, or offset with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation, or \\notherwise, it being agreed that Guarantor will remain  liable under this Guaranty regardless of \\nwhether Borrower or any other person is found not liable on the Guaranteed Obligation, or any \\npart of it, for any  reason.  \\n(j) Any payment by Borrower to Lender is held to constitute a preference under the \\nbankruptcy la ws or if for any other reason Lender is required to refund the payment or pay the \\namount to someone  else. \\n \\nIt is the intent of Guarantor and Lender that the obligations and liabilities of Guarantor under \\nthis Guaranty are absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and that until the \\nGuaranteed Obligation or all amounts required to be paid by Guarantor under this Guaranty are \\nfully and finally paid and performed, the obligations and liabilities will not be discharged or \\nreleased, in whole or  in part, by any act or occurrence that might, but for the provisions of this \\nGuaranty, be deemed a legal or equitable discharge or release of a guarantor.  \\n \\n5. Subordination; Subrogation.  If, for any reason, Borrower is now or later becomes indebted \\nto Guaran tor, the following  applies:  \\n \\n(a) That indebtedness and all interest on it and all liens, security interests, and rights now \\nor later existing with respect to property of Borrower securing the indebtedness will, at all times,  \\nbe subordinate  in all respects  to the Guaranteed  Obligation  and to all liens,  security  interests,  and  \\n7 \\n2019 Bloomin’ Blinds FDD   General Release  \\n rights now or later existing to secure the Guaranteed Obligation. Despite anything to the contrary \\ncontained in this Guaranty or any payments made by any party under this Guaranty, Guarant or \\npermanently and irrevocably waives any right of subrogation in or under any of the Loan \\nDocuments or to participate in any way in the Loan Documents, or in any right, title, or interest in \\nand to any security or right of recourse for the Guaranteed Obli gation.  \\n \\n(b) After the occurrence of a default (whether or not declared) under any of the Loan \\nDocuments, Guarantor will not be entitled to enforce or receive payment, directly or indirectly, of  \\nany indebtedness  of Borrower  to Guarantor  until the Guaranteed  Obligation  has been fully and \\nfinally paid and  performed.  \\n \\n(c) Guarantor assigns and grants to Lender a security interest, as security for the \\nGuaranteed Obligation, in any indebtedness and related security of Borrower to Guarantor now \\nexisting or later arising, including any dividends and payments under the debtor -relief or insolvency  \\nproceedings  referred  to below.  In the event  of receivership,  bankruptcy,  reorganization, \\narrangement, or other debtor -relief or insolvency proceedings involving Borrower as  debtor, \\nLender will have the right to prove its claim so as to establish its rights under this Guaranty and \\nwill have the right to receive  directly  from  the receiver,  trustee,  or other  custodian  (whether  or not \\na default has occurred or is continuing unde r any of the Loan Documents), dividends and payments \\nthat are payable on any obligation of Borrower to Guarantor now existing or later arising, and to \\nhave all benefits of any security for the dividends and payments, until the Guaranteed Obligation \\nhas bee n fully and finally paid and performed. If, despite the foregoing provisions, Guarantor \\nshould receive any payment, claim, or distribution that is prohibited as provided  in this Section,  \\nGuarantor  must  pay the same  to Lender  immediately,  Guarantor  agreeing  that it will receive the \\npayment, claim, or distribution in trust for Lender and will have absolutely no dominion over the \\nsame except to pay it immediately to  Lender.  \\n(d) Guarantor will promptly on Lender\\'s request execute the documents and perform \\nthe acts that Lender may require to evidence and perfect its interest and to permit or facilitate \\nexercise of its rights under this Section, including but not limited to execution and delivery of \\nfinancing statements, proofs of claim, further assignments, and secur ity agreements, and delivery \\nto Lender of any promissory notes or other instruments evidencing indebtedness of Borrower to \\nGuarantor. All promissory notes, accounts -receivable ledgers, or other evidences, now or later held  \\nby Guarantor,  of obligations  of Borrower  to Guarantor  must  contain  a specific  written  notice that  \\nthe indebtedness  evidenced  by them  is subordinated  under  and is subject  to the terms  of this \\nGuaranty.  \\nNothing  in this Guaranty  will operate  as a release  or discharge,  in whole  or in part, of any claim \\nof Guarantor against Borrower, by subrogation or otherwise, by reason of any act done or payment  \\nmade  by Guarantor  under  the provisions  of this Guaranty;  but all such claims,  including claims  for \\nany indebtedness  of Borrower  to Guarantor,  whether  now existing  or later arising,  will be  \\nsubordinate  to the Guaranteed  Obligation  and the liens,  security  interests,  and rights  of Lender \\nunder the Loan  Documents.  \\n \\n6. Other  Liability  of Guarantor  or Borrower.  If Guarantor  becomes  liable  for any indebtedness \\nowed by Borrower to Lender, by endorsement or otherwise, other than under this Guaranty, the \\nliability  will not be in any way impaired  or affected  by this Guaranty,  and the rights  of Lender   \\n8 \\n2019 Bloomin’ Blinds FDD   General Release  \\n under this Guaranty will be cumulative of any and all  other rights that Lender may ever have against  \\nGuarantor.  If Borrower  is or becomes  indebted  to Lender  for other  than the Indebtedness, any  \\npayment  received  or recovery  realized  on any indebtedness  of Borrower  to Lender  may, except to \\nthe extent paid by Guarantor on the Indebtedness or specifically required by law or agreement of  \\nLender  to be applied  to the Indebtedness,  in Lender’s  sole discretion  be applied  on indebtedness of \\nBorrower to Lender other than the  Indebtedness.  \\n \\n7. Lender\\'s Assigns.  This Guaran ty is for the benefit of Lender and Lender’s successors and \\nassigns, and if there is an assignment of the Indebtedness or any part of it the rights and benefits \\nunder this Guaranty, to the extent applicable to the assigned Indebtedness, may be transferred with \\nthe Indebtedness.  Guarantor  waives  notice  of any transfer  or assignment  of the Indebtedness, or any \\npart of it, and agrees that failure to give notice will not affect Guarantor\\'s liabilities under this  \\nAgreement.  \\n \\n8. Binding  Agreement.

GUARANTOR  AGREES \\nAND CONSENTS THAT, IN ADDITION TO ANY METHOD S OF SERVICE OF \\nPROCESS PROVIDED FOR UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SERVICE OF PROCESS IN \\nANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING IN ANY TEXAS STATE COURT, OR ANY \\nUNITED STATES FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN DENTON COUNTY, TEXAS, MAY \\nBE MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, \\nDIRECTED TO GUARANTOR AT GUARANTOR’S ADDRESS STATED IN THIS \\nGUARANTY, OR AT A SUBSEQUENT ADDRESS AT WHICH LENDER RECEIVED \\nACTUAL NOTICE FROM GUARANTOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS GUARANTY, \\nAND SERVICE SO MADE WILL BE COMPLETE FIVE (5)  DAYS AFTER IT HAS BEEN \\nSO MAILED.  \\n10. Invalid Provisions.  If any provision of this Guaranty or the application of any provision to \\nany person or circumstance is, for any reason and to any extent, invalid or unenforceable, neither \\nthe rest of this Guaranty  nor the application  of the provision  to any other  person  or circumstance \\nwill be affected, but rather the same will be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by  law. \\n \\n11. Attorney Fees and Costs of Collection.  Guarantor will pay on demand the reasonable \\nattorn ey fees and all other  costs  and expenses  that may be incurred  by Lender  in the enforcement   \\n9 \\n2019 Bloomin’ Blinds FDD   General Release  \\n of or preservation of Lender’s rights under this Guaranty.

All amounts  payable  under  this Guaranty  will be paid in U.S. currency  that at the \\ntime of payment is legal tender for the payment of public and private  debts.  \\n \\n13. Controlling  Agreement.  It is not the intention  of Lender  or Guarantor  to obligate  Guarantor \\nto pay interest in excess of that legally permitted to be paid by Guarantor under applicable law. \\nShould it be determined that any portion of the Guaranteed Obligation constitutes interest in \\nexcess of the maximum amount of interest that Guarantor (in its capacity as Guar antor) may \\nlawfully be required to pay under applicable law, the obligation of Guarantor to pay the interest \\nwill automatically be limited to the maximum interest payment permitted under applicable law.

See the table of contents.  \\n \\n \\n iv \\n What You Need To Know About Franchising Generally  \\nContinuing responsibility to pay fees. You may have to pay royalties and other fees \\neven if you are losing money.  \\nBusiness model can change. The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor to \\nchange its manuals and business model without your consent. These changes may require \\nyou to make additional investments in your franchise business or may harm your \\nfranchise business.  \\nSupplier restrictions. You may have to buy or lease items from the franchisor or a \\nlimited group of suppliers the franchisor designates. These items may be more expensive \\nthan similar items you could buy on your own.  \\nOperating restrictions. The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating a \\nsimilar business during the term of the franchise. There are usually other restrictions. Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to customers, what \\nyou sell, how you market, and your hours of operation.  \\nCompetition from franchisor. Even if the franchise agreement grants you a territory, the \\nfranchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory.  \\nRenewal. Your franchise agreement may not permit you to renew. Even if it does, you \\nmay have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order to \\ncontinue to operate your franchise business.  \\nWhen your franchise ends . The franchise agreement may  prohibit you from operating a \\nsimilar business after your franchise ends even if you still have obligations to your landlord or other creditors.  \\n \\nSome States Require Registration  \\nYour state may have a franchise law, or other law, that requires franchisors to \\nregister before offering or selling franchises in the state. Registration does not mean that \\nthe state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this document. To find out if your state has a registration requirement, or to contact your state, use the \\nagency information in Exhibit A.  \\nYour state also may have laws that require special disclosures or amendments be \\nmade to your franchise agreement. If so, you should check the State Specific Addenda. See the Table of Contents for the location of the State Specific Addenda.  \\n \\n v \\n Special Risks to Consider About This  Franchise \\n \\nCertain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted:  \\n \\n1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution. The franchise agreement requires you to resolve \\ndisputes with the fr anchisor by mediation arbitration and/or litigation only in New \\nYork. Out -of-state mediation, arbitration, or litigation may force you to accept a less \\nfavorable settlement for disputes. It may also cost more to mediate, arbitrate, or litigate \\nwith the fra nchisor in New York than in your own state.  \\n \\n2. You must make minimum royalty or advertising fund payments, regardless of your \\nsales level. Your inability to make the payments may result in termination of your franchise and loss of your investment. \\n \\n3. Your spouse must sign a document that makes your spouse liable for all financial \\nobligations under the franchise agreement even though your spouse has no ownership \\ninterest in the franchise. This guarantee will place both your and your spouse’s marital \\nand personal assets, perhaps including your house, at risk if the franchise fails.  \\n \\n4. Some of the principal trademarks that you will use in your business are not federally registered. If the franchisor’s right to use this trademark in your area is challenged, you may have to identify your business and its products or services with a name that differs from that used by other franchisees or the franchisor. This change can be expensive and may reduce brand recognition of the products or services you offer.  \\n \\n5. COVID- 19. The coronavirus disease (“COVID -19”) pandemic may have a material \\nadverse impact on our operations, financial performance, and the children’s sports \\neducation and physical fitness programs industry in general. The COVID -19 pandemic \\nhas resulted i n, and is expected to continue to result in, a substantial curtailment of \\nbusiness activities (including restrictions and prohibitions on sports and physical fitness activities), and weakened economic conditions. This unprecedented situation has created ri sks and uncertainties for us and we are unable to predict the full extent to \\nwhich COVID- 19 will continue to adversely impact us, our industry, our franchisees \\nand our customers. The volatile economic conditions stemming from COVID -19 could \\nprecipitate or aggravate risk factors identified herein and affect our operations and financial performance in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks. The ultimate impact of the pandemic will depend on evolving factors, many of which are not within our control. \\nCertain states may require other risks to be highlighted. Check the “State Specific \\nAddenda” (if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be highlighted. \\n \\n \\n vi \\n TABLE OF CONTENTS        PAGE  \\n \\nITEM 1.

It is anticipated and expected that you will work from your home. We have no criteria for any office \\nspace, lease or other real estate.

If you already have equipment and \\nsoftware that satisfies our requirements, you will not need to purchase new computer hardware or \\nsoftware and can spend $0 on your Computer System.  \\n \\n7. The Technology Maintenance Fee is currently $ 150 per month. This figure represents the first 3 \\nmonths of this fee that we collect before you open. We may in the future provide  you with \\nproprietary software at no cost to you.  \\n \\n8. This estimate includes the cost of deposit in order to obtain the minimum required insurance. You \\nshould check with your local carrier for actual premium quotes and costs, as well as the actual cost of \\nthe deposit. The cost of coverage will vary based upon the area in which your Franchised Business \\nwill be located, your experience with the insurance carrier, the loss experience of the carrier and other factors beyond our control.  You should also check with your insurance agent or broker regarding any \\nadditional insurance that you may want to carry. This estimate also includes representative costs for \\nthe engagement of professionals such as attorneys and accountants for the professional services \\nconsistent w ith the start- up of a Franchised Business. We strongly recommend that you seek the \\nassistance of professional advisors when evaluating this franchise opportunity, this disclosure document and the Franchise Agreement.  It is also advisable to consult these professionals to review \\nany contract that you will enter into as part of starting your Franchised Business.

TERRITORY  \\nThe franchise is granted for a geographic area that must be approved by us ( the \\n“Territory”), which will be identified on an attachment to the Franchise Agreement . You may face \\ncompetition from other franchisees, from outlets that we o wn, or from other channels of \\ndistribution or competitive brands that we control.  \\n The geographic boundaries of the Territory will be defined by us by identifying a sufficient \\nnumber of zip codes or by identifying political boundaries such as cities or counties, natural boundaries such as rivers or mountains, man- made boundaries such as highways or streets, or \\notherwise as we deem appropriate in order to describe an area that contains at least seventy (70) \\nqualified locations, such as private pre -schools , public pre -schools, licensed day care centers  for \\nthe Basic Package or the Complete AA Program . We have no control over how these records are \\ncompiled and as a result, we cannot and do not guaranty that the municipality, county, or state will have an accurate record of the identity and location of these facilities. This may result in a pr ivate \\npre-school , public pre -school, day care center , or elementary school  that we thought was located \\nwithin your Territory be located within the exclusive territory of another  franchisee. In such a case, \\nwe will use our good faith efforts to revise your Territory  so that it includes another private pre -\\nschool , public pre -school, day care center , or elementary school, as applicable . We cannot guaranty \\nhowever, that this will happen.  \\n You will operate the Franchised Business at qualified locations loc ated within the Territory \\nor with our consent, qualified locations located outside of the Territory. No other rights are granted to you.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n38 \\n You may not relocate the Franchised Business without our prior written consent. We \\nconsider the following factors in approving your relocation: if you are in compliance with the Franchise Agreement ; and you have paid all monies to us and our A ffiliates. Your Territory will \\nremain the same, regardless of whether or not we consent to the relocation of your Franchised Business.   \\n You will have no right of first refusal, option or other similar right to acquire additional \\nfranchises.  \\n The continuation of the rights to your Territory is not conditioned upon achieving a certain \\nsales volume, market penetration or other contingency. We will not increase or decrease the size of your Territory during the te rm of your Franchise Agreement.  \\n Except as stated below in the reservation of rights , we will not: (i) grant another franchise \\nor open a company- owned or affiliate -owned Amazing Athletes business  within the Territory  that \\noffers the same Program(s) that your  Franchised  Business  offers ; (ii) permit another franchisee, \\nour Affiliates  and their  franchisees, or a company -owned or affiliate -owned business that  offers \\nthe same Program( s) that your Franchised Business  offers  to operate within your Territory; or (iii) \\npermit another franchisee, our Affiliates  and their  franchisees, or a company -owned or affiliate -\\nowned business that  offers the same Program(s) that your Franchised  Business  offers  to accept or \\nsolicit orders to provide services in your Territory.  \\n \\nYou may conduct marketing, solicit business, advertise and provide services only within \\nyour Territory. To maintain your Territory you must continue to meet the requirements of the Franchise Agreement. There are no specific financial performance requirements imposed upon you to maintain your Territory.

Financial performance information that differs from  that included in Item  19 may \\nbe given only if: (1) a franchisor provides  the actual records  of an  existing  outlet you are \\nconsidering buying; or (2)  a franchisor supplements the information provided in this Item 19, \\nfor example, by providing i nformation about possible performance at a particular location or \\nunder particular circumstances.  \\n The financial performance representation being made below is a historic financial \\nperformance representation about a subset of the existing outlets in the fr anchise system  that have \\nbeen granted the right to operate an AA Complete Program  and the  Basic Package.   \\n \\nThe following information represents the “Gross Revenues” of 59 owners representing 96  \\nof our 124  franchised units for the time period of January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. This \\ninformation includes only units that have been operating for at least one ( 1) year and that have \\nbeen owned by the same owner(s) throughout the period of January 1, 2020  through December \\n31, 2020. There are franchised units that did not deliver its Gross Revenues statements in time \\nfor this compilation and  twenty -eight (28 ) additional franchised units did not report because they \\nwere either open for less than one ( 1) year or they were transferred to other franchisees during \\nthe year . “Gross Revenues” is defined as the gross revenue generated by a Business for all of the \\nservices it provi des. Gross Revenues does not account for any deduction of fees and costs paid to \\nus (Items 5, 6, 7 and 8), of  wages, fees, taxes, or costs paid to any employee or independent \\ncontractor hired by a franchisee, for the payment of taxes, or for any other oper ating expenses, \\nfees, costs, or deductions that the franchisee may decide to subtract from Gross Revenues.  \\n \\nThe average monthly Gross Revenues for all reporting units was $3,180.69. Forty -five \\n(45) units , representing 46.9% of the reporting units, reported average monthly Gross Revenues \\nabove this number, and fifty-one ( 51) units , representing 53.1% of the reporting units, reported \\naverage monthly Gross Revenues below the average. The median monthly Gross Revenues for all reporting units was $2,554.92. Forty -five ( 45) units, representing 46.9% of the reporting units , \\nreported monthly Gross Revenues above the median, and fifty -one ( 51) units, representing 53.1% \\nof the reporting units, reported average monthly Gross Revenues below the average , reporte d \\nmonthly Gross Revenues below the median. The highest grossing unit had average monthly sales of $10,639.67. The lowest grossing unit had average monthly sales of $0. \\n \\nThe average monthly Gross Revenues for all reporting owners (some of whom own more \\nthan one unit) was $ 5,002.44. The average monthly Gross Revenues is based on average per unit \\nsales. Of the fifty -nine (59) owners (who own the ninety- six (96) units), thirty  (30) owners , \\nrepresenting 50.8% of the reporting owners, reported average monthly Gross Revenues at or \\nabove this average, and twenty -nine ( 29) owners , representing 49.2% of the reporting owners,  \\nreported average monthly Gross Revenues below the average. The median monthly Gross Revenues for all reporting owners  was $3,781.35.  The median monthly Gross Revenues is based  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n52 \\n on the per unit sales. Of the fifty -nine (59) owners , thirty (30) owners , representing 50.8% of the \\nreporting owners  reported monthly Gross Revenues at or above this median, and twenty -nine (29) \\nowners, representing 49.2% of the reporting owners reported Gross Revenues below the median. \\nThe highest grossing owner (who owns three (3) units) had combined average monthly sales of \\n$24,000 for the three (3)  units. The lowest grossing owner (who owns 1 unit) had average \\nmonthly sales of $0. \\n \\nFor the two tables below, financials were sorted based on average monthly Gross \\nRevenues per reporting owner sales rather than per unit basis . The top 25% represents the top \\nfifteen  (15) owners with the highest average monthly Gross Revenues (regardless of number of \\nunits) and the bottom 25% represents the bottom fifteen  (15) owners with the lowest average \\nmonthly Gross Revenues  (regardless of number of units) . \\n \\nPERFORMANC E OF TOP 25%  \\nAverage \\nAnnual  \\nSales  by Owner  Average \\nAnnual Sales  \\nby Unit  Average \\nMonthly Sales  \\nby Owner  Average \\nMonthly  \\nSales by \\nUnit # Owners \\nrepresented \\nin top 25%  # Units \\nrepresented in top 25%  \\n$133,189.65  $79,902.35  $11,099.14  $6,658.53  15 37 \\n \\nPERFORMANCE OF TOP 25%  \\nMedian \\nAnnual Sales  \\nby Owner  Median \\nAnnual Sales  \\nby Unit  Median \\nMonthly Sales  \\nby Owner  Median \\nMonthly  \\nSales by Unit  # Owners \\nrepresented \\nin top 25%  # Units \\nrepresented \\nin top 25%  \\n$118,718.00  $73,250.81  $9,893.17  $6,104.23  15 37 \\n \\nOf the top 25%, four (4 ) owners own one (1) unit; four (4 ) owners own two (2) units ; five \\n(5) owners own three (3) units ; one (1) owner owns (4) units ; and  one owner (1) owns six (6) \\nunits . \\nThe states in which the top 25% have  their locations  are as  follows:  California, Florida, \\nGeorgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South \\nCarolina and Texas . \\n \\nOf the top 25 %, eleven  (11) owners  have been in the system for five (5) years or more and \\nfour (4) have been in the system for less than five (5) years.

Further, the transferee entity must expressly assume all of Franchisee’s \\nobligations under this Agreement and Franchisee must agree to remain personally liable under this \\nAgreement as if t he transfer to this entity did not occur; and  \\n \\n(3) A fee in an amount of $ 10,000 must be paid as follows: Franchisee \\nshall pay $1,000 upon submission of the transfer application to Franchisor; Franchisee shall pay \\n$4,000 upon completion of the Transfer ; and transferee shall pay $5,000 upon completion of the \\nTransfer.  \\n \\n(x) Franchisee (and its Owners ) signs a General Release in the form attached as \\nExhibit 4, of any and all claims agai nst the Released Parties ; \\n  \\n(xi) Franchisor, in its sole discretion, has determined that the terms of the \\ntransfer , including but not limited to price, method and the extent of financing will not adversely \\naffect the transferee\\'s operation of the Franchised Business;  \\n \\n(xii) if Franchisee or its O wners  finance any part of the purchase price, \\nFranchisee and/or its Owners  agree that all of the transferee\\'s obligations under promissory notes, \\nagreements or security interests reserved in the Franchised Business are subordi nate to the \\ntransferee\\'s obligation to pay the Royalty, Franchisee National Advertising Fees and other amounts due to Franchisor , its af filiates, Suppliers  and otherwise comply with this Agreement;  \\n (xiii) Franchisee and its Owners will not for two (2) years begi nning on the \\neffective date of the transfer, engage in any of the activities prohibited in Article IX of this Agreement;  \\n \\n(xiv) Franchisee and its Owners  will not directly or indirectly at any time or in \\nany manner (except with respect to other Amazing Athletes  franchises they own and operate) \\nidentify themselves or any business as a current or former Amazing Athletes  franchise or as one \\nof Franchisor ’s franchisees; use any of the Principal Trademark s, any colorable imitation of a \\nPrincipal Trademark or other indicia of the  Amazing Athletes  System in any manner or for any \\npurpose; or utilize for any purpose any trade name, trade mark  or service mark, or other commercial \\nsymbol that suggests or indicates  a connection or association with Franchisor ; \\n  \\n51 \\n  \\n  \\n (xv) Franchisee shall comply with all other applicable transfer requirements as \\ndesignated in the Confidential Operating Manual or otherwise in writing;  \\n \\n(xvi) Franchisor in its sole discretion determines that the terms of the transfer are \\nsubstantially the same as those offered to Franchisor  pursuant to Franchisor’s right of first refusal \\nin accordance with Article XI  herein;  \\n \\n(xvii)  transferee (and its owners if transferee is an entity) passes a credit and \\ncriminal background check ;   \\n \\n(xviii)  transferee (and its owners if transferee is an entity) execute a personal \\nguaranty in the form attached as Exhibit 9 guaranteeing the obligations of Franchisee ; and  \\n \\n(xix) transferee will replace all equipment used for the Franchised Business by or \\nbefore the transfer date, if the equipment had not been replaced within  two (2) years prior to the \\ndate of transfer.  \\n \\n(b) Franchisor may review all information regarding the Franchise d Business that \\nFranchisee gives the transferee, correct any information that it believes is inaccurate and give the \\ntransferee copies of any reports that Franchisee has given Franchisor or Franchisor has made regarding the Franchise d Business.  \\n \\n10.4  Death or Disability of Franchisee  \\n \\n(a) Transfer Upon Death or Disability.  \\n \\nUpon the death or disability of Franchisee or its Operating Principal, the executor, \\nadministrator, conservator, guardian or other personal representative of Franchisee or its Operating \\nPrincipal  must transfer Franchisee\\'s interest in this Agreement or the Operating Principal\\'s \\nownership interest in Franchisee to a third -party  (which may be the heirs, beneficiaries or devisees \\nof Franchisee or the Operating Principal). That transfer must be completed within a reasonable \\ntime not to exceed six (6) months from the date of death or disability and is subject to all of the terms and co nditions in this Article X. A failure to transfer Franchisee\\'s interest in this Agreement \\nor the Operating Principal\\'s ownership interest in Franchisee within this time period is a breach of \\nthis Agreement. The term \"disability\" means a mental or physical disability, impairment or condition that is reasonably expected to prevent or actually does prevent Franchisee or the \\nOperating Principal from supervising the management and operation of the Franchised Business . \\n \\n(b) Operation Upon Death or Disability.  \\n \\nIf upon the death or disability of Franchisee or the Operating Principal, a manager trained \\nby Franchisor or Franchisee is not managing the Franchise d Business, the executor, administrator, \\nconservator, guardian or other personal representative of the Franchisee or the Operating Principal   \\n52 \\n  \\n  \\n must within a reasonable time not to exceed fifteen (15) days from the date of death or disability, \\nappoint a m anager. The replacement m anager must complete Franchisor’s standard training \\nprogram at Franchisee\\'s sole expens e. A new Operating Principal acceptable to Franchisor  also \\nmust be appointed within thirty (30) days. If in Franchisor’s judgment, the Franchise d Business is \\nnot being managed properly any time after the death or disability of Franchisee or the Operating Principal, Franchisor , an affiliate or a third party designated by the Franchisor may but need not \\nassume the management of the Franchised Business . All funds from the operation of the \\nFranchised Business while under the management of the Franchisor , an aff iliate  or a third -party \\nwill be kept in a separate account and all expenses will be charged to this account. Franchisor may charge Franchisee (in addition to the Royalty, Franchisee National Advertising Fee s and other \\namounts due under this Agreement) a pe r diem fee, plus direct out -of-pocket costs and expenses  \\nof the Franchisor , an affiliate or a third -party , if Franchisor , an affiliate  or a third -party  assumes \\nthe management of the Franchised Business under this subsection. Franchisor , an affiliate  or a \\nthird -party , as applicable,  has a duty to utilize only reasonable efforts and will not be liable to \\nFranchisee or its O wners for any debts, losses or obligations incurred by the Franchised Business , \\nor to any of Franchisee\\'s creditors for any products, other assets, or services the Franchised Business purchases while under the management of Franchisor , an affiliate  or a third -party.  \\n 10.5 Effect of Consent to Transfer  \\n \\nFranchisor’s consent to a transfer of this Agreement , the Franchised Business  or any \\ninterest in Franchisee or its  Owners  is not (i) a representation of the fairness of the terms of any \\ncontract between Franchisee and the transferee ; (ii) a guarantee of the prospects of success  of the \\nFranchised Business or transferee; nor (iii) a waiver of any claims Franchisor  has against \\nFranchisee  (or its Operating Principals ) or of Franchisor ’s right to demand the transferee\\'s full \\ncompliance with this Agreement. In the event of a transfer, Franchisee and/or its O wners shall \\ncontinue to remain obligated t o Franchisor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  \\n \\n10.6 Proposed Assignment as a Result of Franchisee’s Bankruptcy  \\n \\n(a) Franchisee again  acknowledges  that the rights  and duties  along  with  the Franchise  \\ngranted  in this Agreement  are personal  to Franchisee (or any of its Owners),  and Franchisor  \\nhas entered  into this Agreement  in reliance  on the representations  given  by Franchisee to \\nsecure the Franchise , the personal  and/or  collective  skills  of Franchisee and its Owners, as \\napplicable, and the financial  ability  of Franchisee and its Owners . Franchisee further \\nacknowledges  and agrees  that because of the personal  nature  of the rights  and duties  associated  \\nwith the Franchise,  this Agreement  is not freely  assignable  by its nature  and therefore it would  \\nnot be appropriate  to assign  the rights  and obligations  to any assignee  other  than in accordance  \\nwith this Section  10 (and each other  applicable provision  of this Section  10). In the event  that \\nFranchisee shall become  a debtor  under  Chapter  7 of the United  States  Bankruptcy  Code, 11 \\nUSC  Section  101, et seq., (the “Bankruptcy Code ”), and the trustee  or Franchisee shall  elect  to \\nassume  this Agreement  for the purpose  of assigning  the same or otherwise,  such election  and \\nassignment  may only be made if all of the terms  and conditions  of this Agreement  are  \\n53 \\n  \\n  \\n satisfied.  No election  by the trustee  or Franchisee to assume  this Agreement,  whether  under  \\nChapter  7, 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, shall be effective  unless  each of the following  \\nconditions, and as applicable,  any other  conditions  required  in this Section  10, which  Franchisor  \\nand Franchisee each acknowledge  is commercially  reasonable  in the context  of such \\nproceeding,  has been satisfied, and  Franchisor has  so acknowledged  in writing:  \\n \\n(i) the trustee  or Franchisee  has cured,  or has provided  Franchisor  adequate  \\nassurance (as provided below)  that: (i) within  ten (10) days from  the date of such assumption,  \\nthe trustee  will cure all monetary defaults  under  this Agreement;  and (ii) within  thirty  (30) days \\nfrom  the date of such assumption,  the trustee  will cure all non-monetary  defaults  under  this \\nAgreement;  \\n  \\n(ii) the Franchised  Business remains  at all times  under  the primary  \\nmanagement  of an Owner or a manager trained by Franchisor or Franchisee or  who otherwise  \\nmeets  Franchisor’s qualifications  and has  completed,  to Franchisor’s satisfaction,  a training \\nprogram in substance similar  to the initial t raining  program described  in Section 6.2 ; \\n \\n(iii) the trustee  or Franchisee has and will continue  to have  sufficient  \\nunencumbered assets  after the payment  of all secured  obligations  and administrative  expenses  \\nto assure  Franchisor  that the trustee  or Franchisee  will have sufficient  funds  to fulfill  the \\nobligations  of Franchisee  under  this Agreement,  and to keep  the Franchised  Business  open  and \\noperating  fully stocked and properly  staffed  with sufficient employees  to conduct  a fully-\\noperational  Franchised  Business , and that the assumption  or assignment  will not disrupt  \\nbusiness operations at the  Franchised  Business ; and \\n \\n(iv) that assumption or assignment  of this Agreement  will not breach  any term \\nor condition  of, or constitute  a default  under, any term or condition of any contract,  agreement,  \\narrangement,  or other  commitment to which  the trustee  or Franchisee is a party  or by which  the \\ntrustee  or Franchisee is bound  (including any agreement not  to compete ), or constitute  an event \\nwhich, with notice,  lapse of time or both, would result  in such a breach  or event  of default  nor \\nto the trustee’s  or Franchisee’s  knowledge, result  in the violation  by the trustee  or Franchisee \\nof any applicable statute,  rule, regulation, ordinance, code, judgment, order, injunction or  decree.  \\n \\n(b) If a trustee  or Franchisee,  pursuant  to this Agreement,  proposes  to assign  this \\nAgreement  or any right  in the Franchise pursuant  to the provisions  of the Bankruptcy  Code, to \\nany person  or entity  who shall  have  made  a bona  fide offer to accept  an assignment  of this \\nAgreement  on terms  acceptable to the trustee  or Franchisee,  then, notice  of the proposed \\nassignment  setting  forth  (i) the name  and address  of such person;  and (ii) all of the terms  and \\nconditions  of such offer shall  be given  to the Franchisor  by the Franchisee  no later than twenty  \\n(20) days after receipt  of such offer  by the trustee  or Franchisee,  but in any event  no later than \\nten (10) days prior  to the date that the trustee  Franchisee shall  make application  to a court  of \\ncompetent  jurisdiction  for authority and  approval  to enter  into such  assignment  and assumption.  \\n  \\n54 \\n  \\n  \\n (c) If the trustee  or Franchisee,  pursuant  to this Agreement,  proposes  to assign  this \\nAgreement  or any right in the Franchise  pursuant  to the provisions  of the Bankruptcy  Code,  to \\nany person  or entity  who shall have  made  a bona  fide offer to accept  an assignment  of this \\nAgreement  on terms  acceptable  to the trustee  or Franchisee,  Franchisor  shall thereupon have  the \\nprior  right and option,  to be exercised  by notice  to the trustee  or Franchisee given at any time \\nprior  to the effective date of such proposed assignment, to accept  an assignment  of this Agreement  \\nupon the  same terms  and conditions  and for the same consideration, if any, as the bona  fide offer  \\nmade by such person.  \\n \\n(d) Any person or entity  to which  the trustee’s  or Franchisee’s  interest  in this \\nAgreement  is assigned  pursuant  to the provisions  of the Bankruptcy  Code  shall be deemed  \\nwithout  further  act or deed to have assumed  all of the obligations  arising  under  this Agreement  \\non or after the date of such assignment.  As part of providing  adequate  assurance to Franchisor,  \\nany such assignee  shall,  upon demand, execute and deliver  to Franchisor  an instrument  \\nconfirming such  assumption. \\n (e) The following factors  may be considered by Franchisor  as necessary  in order  to \\ndetermine whether  or not the proposed  assignee  has furnished Franchisor  with adequate  \\nassurances  of its ability  to perform  the obligations of this Agreement , in accordance with Section \\n10.6(a)(i) above : \\n \\n(i) the assignee (and its owners if assignee is an entity) has satisfied \\nFranchisor that it meets Franchisor’s management, business experience and aptitude, and \\nfinancial standards for franchisees, has met  all of Franchisor’s then- current standards and \\nrequirements for becoming a n Amazing Athletes  franchisee (which standards and requirements \\nneed not be in writing) and otherwise possesses the character and capabilities, including business reputation and credit rating, as Franchisor may require to demonstrate ability to conduct the Franchised Business;  \\n \\n(ii) that assumption  or assignment  of this Agreement  is subject  to all the \\nprovisions  hereof,  including  provisions  such as location,  use, and the restrictive  covenants  set \\nforth  in Articles 8 and 9 , and  will not breach  any term or condition of, or constitute  a default  \\nunder, any term or condition  of any contract,  agreement,  arrangement,  or other  commitment  to \\nwhich  the assignee  or any holder  of a legal  or beneficial  interest  in assignee  is a party  or by \\nwhich  assignee or such holder  of a legal  or beneficial  interest  in assignee is bound  (including  \\nany agreement  not to compete ), or constitute  an event  which, with notice,  lapse  of time or both, \\nwould  result  in such a breach  or event  of default  nor to assignee’s  knowledge,  result  in the \\nviolation  by assignee  or any such holder  of a legal  or beneficial  interest  in assignee of any \\napplicable  statute,  rule, regulation, ordinance, code,  judgment,  order, injunction or decree; and  \\n \\n(iii) demonstration that the assumption  or assignment  will not disrupt  \\nbusiness  operations  of the Franchised Business . \\n  \\n55 \\n  \\n  \\n (f) In the event  Franchisor  rejects  the proposed assignee,  to the extent  permitted  by \\napplicable  law, the rights  and obligations  of the parties  hereto  shall  continue  to be governed by \\nthe terms  of this Agreement,  and Franchisee shall have all the rights  of a franchisee under  \\napplicable  law. \\n \\nXI.  RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO ACQUIRE FRANCHISEE’S BUSINESS  \\n 11.1 Franchisor’s Right of First Refusal  \\n \\n(a) Franchisor shall have the right, exercisable within thirty (30) days after receipt of \\nnotice set forth in Section 10.3(a)(i) and the details of the proposed transfer and bona fide offer, to send written notice to Franchisee that Franchisor intends to purchase the interest in this Agreement, the Franchised Business or an ownership interest in Franchisee proposed to be transferred.  \\nFranchisor may assign this right of first refusal to a third -party either before or after Franchisor \\nexercises such right.  However, this right of first refusal shall not apply to transfers  among \\nFranchisee’s current O wners or to a legal entity wholly owned by Franchisee.  \\n (b) Notice of the bona fide offer must include a description  of the interest in the \\nFranchisee or this Agreement and the Franchised Business to be sold,  the proposed payment terms, \\nincluding amount of the contract deposit, the sources and terms of any financing for the proposed purchase price  and a description of any conditions to closing which have been requested by the \\nprospective transferee. To be a valid bona f ide offer, the proposed purchase price must be  stated  \\nin U.S. dollar s and the prospective transferee must submit with its offer an earnest money deposit \\nequal to five percent (5%) or more of the offering price. The right of first refusal process will not be triggered by a proposed transfer that would not be permitted under Article X. Franchisor may \\nrequire Franchisee (or its O wners) to send Franchisor copies of any materials or information sent \\nto the proposed prospective  transferee regarding the possible t ransaction.  \\n \\n(b) Franchisor may by written notice delivered to Franchisee  or its selling O wner(s) \\nwithin thirty (30) days after it receives an exact copy of the bona fide offer and all other  information \\nFranchisor requests, elect to purchase the interest offered under the same terms or conditions contained in the bona fide offer provided that:  \\n \\n(i) Franchisor may , in its sole discretion,  substitute cash, notes payable \\nmonthly in no less than five (5) years , or some combination of each for any form of payment \\nproposed in the bona fide offer (such as ownership interests in a privately- held entity) and \\nFranchisor’s credit shall  be deemed equal to the credit of any prospective  transferee (meaning that \\nif the proposed consideration includes a promissory note, Franchisor may provide a promissory note with the same terms as those offered by the prospective transferee) ; \\n \\n(ii) Franchisor will have an additional thirty (30) days to prepare for closi ng \\nafter notifying Franchisee of its election to purchase; and \\n  \\n56 \\n  \\n  \\n (iii) Franchisor must receive, and Franchisee and its O wners agree to make, all \\ncustomary representations and warranties given by the seller of the assets of a business or the \\nownership interests in a legal entity, as applicable, including without limitation representations \\nand warranties regarding:  \\n \\n(1) ownership and condition of and title to ownership interests and/or \\nassets; liens and encumbrances relating to ownership interests and/or ass ets; and  \\n (2) validity of contracts and the liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of \\nthe entity whose assets or ownership interests are being purchased.  \\n \\n(c) If Franchisor exercises its right of first refusal, Franchisee and its selling Owners \\nagree that for t wo (2) years beginning on the closing date, they will be bound by the covenants \\ncontained in subsection 9.1(d)  of this Agreement.  \\n (d) If Franchisor does not exercise its right of first refusal, Franchisor shall , within \\nthirty (30) days after the right of  first refusal has expired, notify Franchisee ( and/or any of its \\nOwners) in writing of its approval or disapproval of the prospective transferee. Franchisee or its \\nOwners may complete the sale to the prospective  transferee on the terms and conditions state d \\nwithin the bona fide  offer  provided to Franchisor pursuant to subsection 11.1(a) , but only if \\nFranchisor  otherwise approves the transfer in accordance with Section 10.3 and Franchisee (and \\nits Owners) and the transferee comply with the conditions of that  Section .  This means that even \\nif Franchisor  does not exercise its right of first refusal (whether or not it is properly triggered as \\nprovided above), if the proposed transfer otherwise would not be allowed under Section 10.3, then \\nFranchisee (or its O wners) may not complete the transfer.  \\n (e)  If Franchisee (or its O wners) does not complete the transfer to the prospective  \\ntransferee within sixty (60) days after Franchisor notifies Franchisee ( and/or any of its O wners) \\nthat Franchisor does not intend to exercise its right of first refusal, or if there is a material change in the terms of the transfer (which Franchisee  and/or its Owners  agree to promptly advise  \\nFranchisor ), then Franchisor or its designee will have an additional right of first refusal during the \\nthirty (30) day period following either the expiration of the sixty (60) day period or  Franchisor’s \\nreceipt of notice of the material change(s) in the sale\\'s terms .  This additional right of first refusal \\nshall be to purchase  on the terms originally offered or the modified terms, at the option of \\nFranchisor or its designee . \\n \\n11.2  Public Offerings  \\n \\nDespite any other provisions in this Agreement, Franchisee (and its Owners ) may not \\nattempt to raise or secure funds by selling or offering to sell any ownership interest in Franchisee (including without limitation common or preferred stock, bonds, debentures, membership interests or general or limited partnership interests) in a public offering for which a registration statement must be filed with the Securities Exchange Commission or with any similar state regulatory  \\n57 \\n  \\n  \\n authority having jurisdiction over the sale of securities where registration is required as a condition \\nof the s ale of securities in that state.  \\n  \\nXII.

MISCELLANEOUS  \\n22.1  Execution, Construction and  Interpretation  \\n \\n(a) This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which will be \\nconsidered an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.  \\n72 \\n  \\n  \\n Facsimile or other electronic execution signatures will be considered as binding and conclusive as \\nif original, provided that any party so executing must use all commercially reasonable efforts to \\nfurnish to the other party(ies) the originally executed document at the earliest opportunity.  \\n (b) The titles and subtitles of the various A rticles , Sections and subsections of this \\nAgreement are inserted for convenience and will not affect the meaning or construction of any of the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Agreement. The terms used in this Agreement, regardless of the num ber and gender in which they are used shall be construed to \\ninclude the other number (singular or plural), and other genders (masculine, feminine, or neuter), as the context or sense of this Agreement or any Articles , Sections  or subsections  may require. T he \\nlanguage of this Agreement will be in all cases construed simply according to its fair and plain \\nmeaning and not strictly for or against Franchisor  or Franchisee.  \\n (c) It is agreed that if any provision of this Agreement is capable of two (2) \\nconstructions, one of which would render the provision void and the other of which would render the provision valid, then the provision will have the meaning which renders it valid. \\n (d) The parties agree to execute all other documents and perform all further  acts \\nnecessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.  \\n (e) Each reference in this Agreement to a corporation or partnership will also refer to \\na limited liability company , general or limited partnership and any other entity or similar \\norganization. Each reference to the organizational documents, shareholders, directors, officers and stock of a corporation in this Agreement will also refer to the functional equivalents of the organizational documents, shareholders, directors, officers and vot ing and/or equity rights, as \\napplicable, in the case of a limited liability company, general partnership, limited partnership or any other entity or similar organization (this specifically includes members and managers, general and limited partners, member ship interests and general and limited partnership interests). \\n 22.2  Severability  \\n \\nNothing contained in this Agreement may be construed as requiring the commission of any \\nact contrary to law. Whenever there is any conflict between any provision of this Agreement and any present or future statute, law, ordinance or regulation required to be made applicable to this Agreement, the latter will prevail, but the affected provision of this Agreement will be curtailed and limited only to the extent necessary to br ing it within the requirement of the law. If any A rticle, \\nSection,  subsection, sentence or clause of this Agreement is held to be indefinite, invalid or \\notherwise unenforceable, the entire Agreement will not fail for this reason and the balance of the Agre ement will continue in full force and effect. If any court of competent jurisdiction deems any \\nprovision of this Agreement (other than for the payment of money) so unreasonable as to be unenforceable as a matter of law, the court may declare a reasonable m odification of this \\nAgreement and this Agreement will be valid and enforceable and the parties agree to be bound by and perform this Agreement as so modified.  \\n73 \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n22.3 Similar Agreements  \\n \\n Franchisor makes no warranty or representation that anything contained in this Agreement \\nmay be construed as requiring that all Amazing Athletes franchise agreements heretofore or \\nhereafter issued by Franchisor to  contain terms substantially similar to tho se contained in this \\nAgreement. Further, Franchisee agrees and acknowledges that Franchisor may, in its reasonable business judgment, due to local business conditions or otherwise, waive or modify comparable provisions of other franchise agreements heretof ore or hereafter granted to other Amazing Athletes  \\nfranchisees in a non- uniform manner, subject to those provisions of this Agreement which require \\nFranchisor to act toward its franchisees on a reasonably non- discriminatory basis.  \\n XXIII.

If, however, any \\nprovision of this Agreement would not be enforceable under the laws of  New Jersey , and if the \\nFranchised Business is located outside of  New Jersey  and the provision would be enforceable \\nunder the laws of the state in which the Franchised Business is located, then the provision (and only that provision) will be interpreted and construed under the laws of that state. Nothing in this Section 2 3.3 is intended to invoke the application of any franchise, business opportunity, antitrust, \\n\"implied covenant,\" unfair competition, fiduciary or any other doctrine of law of the state of  New \\nJersey  or any other state, which would not otherwise apply. \\n 23.4   Arbitration, Jurisdiction and Venue  \\n \\n(a) All claims, controversies or disputes, except for those claims, controversies or \\ndisputes provided for in S ection 23.4(g ), the party asserting the claim shall submit such claim, \\ncontroversy or dispute exclusi vely to arbitration, to be held in New York, New York, before and \\nin accordance with the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the AAA.   \\n \\n(b) Any arbitration under this subsection 23.4 shall be conducted by a single arbitrator \\nmutually agreed to by the parties. I f within thirty (30) days after a demand for arbitration is made, \\nthe parties are unable to agree on a single arbitrator, an arbitrator shall be selected in the following manner: Franchisor and Franchisee shall obtain an identical list of arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association, containing an odd number of arbitrators, and shall take alternating turns striking the name of an arbitrator off the list until one name remains. Franchisee shall strike the first name off the list.  \\n (c) In no event shall the arbitrator be entitled to award punitive, incidental, special or \\nconsequential damages against the Franchisor.    \\n (d) Any award rendered in connection with an arbitration pursuant to this S ection 23.4 \\nshall be final and binding. The parties may initiate litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction to confirm, enter and enforce such arbitration award. \\n (e) Franchisor and Franchisee agree that arbitration will be conducted only on an \\nindividual, not a class -wide, basis, and that an arbitration proceeding between Franchisor \\n(including its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, managers, representatives and employees) and Franchisee (including its Owners, Operating Principal, principals and guarantors, if applicable)  may not be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding between \\nthem and any other person or legal entity. No findings, conclusions, orders or awards emanating  \\n75 \\n  \\n  \\n from any arbitration proceeding conducted hereunder may be introduced, referred to or use d in \\nany subsequent or other proceeding as a precedent, to collaterally estop any party from advancing \\nany claim or defense or from raising any like or similar issues, or for any other purpose whatsoever. The parties agree that the principles of collateral  estoppel shall not apply in any arbitration \\nproceeding conducted under this Section. \\n (f) Franchisor and Franchisee hereby agree and acknowledge that this Section 23.4 \\nshall bind Franchisee’s guarantors, whether or not such guarantors were named parties to the mediation, arbitration and/or litigation.  \\n (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Franchisor may institute litigation \\n(without first proceeding with arbitration) exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction: (1) to protect the Principal Trad emarks, any intellectual property and Confidential Information; (2) to \\ndetermine the validity of termination of this Agreement and/or any other related agreement; (3) to enforce the termination of this Agreement and/or any other related agreement; (4)  to enforce the \\nConfidentiality, Non- Use and Non- Competition Agreement and any other agreement executed by \\nfranchisee; (5) to confirm, enter and enforce an arbitrator’s award; (6) for monies owed; and (7) to enjoin or restrain Franchisee from otherwise causing immediate and irreparable harm to Franchisor, its parent and/or its affiliates.   \\n (h) Franchisee explicitly affirms and recognizes the unique value and secondary \\nmeaning attached to the System, the Principal Tradem arks, any intellectual property and the \\nConfi dential Information. Accordingly, Franchisee agrees that any non- compliance by Franchisee \\nwith the terms of this Agreement and/or the terms of any Confidentiality, Non -Use and Non -\\nCompetition Agreement, Franchisee’s operation of the franchise post -termination or any \\nunauthorized or improper use of the\\n System, the Principal Trademarks , any intellectual property, \\nor Confidential Information by the Franchisee, will cause irreparable damage to the Franchisor, its affiliates and other Amazing Athletes  franchisees. Franchisee therefore agrees that if it engages in \\nany non- compliant, post -termination operation of the franchise or unauthorized and/or improper \\nuse of the System, Principal Trademarks  or Confidential Information during or after the period of \\nthis Agree ment, Franchisor will be entitled to a declaration, temporary injunctive relief and \\npermanent injunctive relief, without the need of a bond, against the Franchisee from any court of competent jurisdiction, wherever situated, as Franchisor may select, in addition to all other remedies which the Franchisor may have at law.   \\n (i) Except as necessary to protect or enforce Franchisor’s or Franchisee’s rights in the \\nproceeding, the arbitration proceeding and all information disclosed therein shall be subject to the confidentiality requirements of this Agreement.  \\n (j) The provisions of this Section are intended to benefit and bind certain third party \\nnon-signatories (including without limitation Franchisee’s Owners and guarantors) and will \\ncontinue in full force and effe ct subsequent to and notwithstanding the expiration or termination \\nof this Agreement.   \\n76 \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n(k) The parties agree that for purposes of Section 23.4(g), a court of competent \\njurisdiction shall mean a court which is either a New York  state court in  New York , New York  or \\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York  in New  York, New York . \\nFranchisee hereby irrevocably submits itself and its guarantors to the jurisdiction and venue of a  \\nNew York state court in New York , New York  or in the United States District Court for the \\nSouthern District of New York  in New  York , New York . Franchisee hereby waives and covenants \\nnever to assert or claim that this venue is for any reason improper, inconvenient, prejudicial or otherwise inappropriate (including, without limitation, any claim under  the judicial doctrine of \\nforum non conveniens).  \\n (l) Notwithstanding Section  23.4(k), if Franchisor determines that another court of \\ncompetent jurisdiction, wherever situated, is appropriate, Franchisor may bring an action in such court. Franchisee hereby irrevocably submits itself and its guarantor s to the jurisdiction and venue \\nof such court as Franchisor may select . Franchisee hereby waives and covenants never to assert or \\nclaim that this venue is for any reason improper, inconvenient, prejudicial or otherwise inappropriate (including, without lim itation, any claim under the judicial doctrine of forum non \\nconveniens).  \\n \\n23.5  Consequential or Punitive Damages  \\n   IN NO EVENT WILL FRANCHISOR  BE LIABLE TO FRANCHISEE  FOR \\nCONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT; ANY BREACH, TERMINATION, CANCELLATION OR NON- RENEWAL OF THIS AGREEMENT; OR IN \\nANY OTHER ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATE S. FRANCHISEE  HEREBY \\nWAIVES AND COVENANTS NEVER TO ADVANCE ANY SUCH CLAIM FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.  \\n \\n23.6  Waiver of Trial by Jury \\n   \\n  TO THE EXTENT THAT EACH MAY LAWFULLY DO SO, FRANCHISEE  AND \\nFRA NCHISOR  BOTH WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION \\nTHAT MAY BE BROUGHT ON OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.  \\n XXIV.   GUARANTEE  \\n(a) If Franchisee  is a partnership, corporation or a limited liability company, p ersonal \\nguarantees shall be required from all O wners . Such personal guarantees must be executed on \\nFranchisor’s standard form Guarantee (Exhibit 9) concurrently with the execution of this Agre ement.  \\n  \\n77 \\n  \\n  \\n (b) If Franchisee is in breach or default under this Agreement, Franchisor  may proceed \\ndirectly against each such individual and/or entity without first proceeding against Franchisee and \\nwithout proceeding against or naming in the suit any other such individuals and/or entities. \\nFranchisee’s obligations and those of each such individual and/or entity will be joint and several. Notice to or demand upon one such individual and/or entity will be considered notice to or demand upon Franchisee and all su ch individual s and/or entities and no notice or demand need be made to \\nor upon all such individuals and/or entities. The cessation of or release from liability of Franchisee  \\nor any such individual and/or entity will not relieve any other individual and/or entity from li ability \\nunder this Agreement, except to the extent that the breach or default has been remedied or money owed has been paid.  \\n XXV.    SURVIVAL  \\n  Any provision of this Agreement which imposes an obligation following the termination \\nor expiration of this Agre ement will survive the termination or expiration and will continue to be \\nbinding upon the parties to this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their heirs, successors and assigns. \\n \\nXXVI .

Governing Law , Arbitration, Jurisdiction and Venue  \\na. This Guarantee, all relations between the parties and any and all \\ndisputes between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, are to be exclusively construed in accordance with and/or governed by (as applicable) the law of the State of New Jersey  without recourse to New Jersey  (or any other) choice of law or conflicts \\nof law principles. If, however, any provision of this Guarantee would not be enforceable under the laws of New Jersey , and if any Franchised Business is located outside of New \\nJersey  and the provision would be enforceable under the laws of that state, then the \\nprovision (and only that provision) will be interpreted and construed under the laws of that state. Nothing in this Section 8 is intended to invoke the application of any franchise, business opportunity, antitrust, \"implied covenant,\" unfair competition, fiduciary or any other doctrine of law of the s tate of  New Jersey or any other state, which would not \\notherwise apply.  \\nb. All claims, controversies or disputes, except for those claims, \\ncontroversies or disputes provided for in Section 23.4(g), the party asserting the claim shall submit such claim, controversy or dispute exclusively to arbitration, to be held in New York, New York, before and in accordance with the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of \\nthe AAA.   \\nc. Any arbitration under this S ection  8 shall be conducted by a single \\narbitrator mutually agreed to by the parties. If within thirty (30) days after a demand for arbitration is made, the parties are unable to agree on a single arbitrator, an arbitrator shall be selected in the following manner : Franchisor and Guarantor  shall obtain an identical list \\nof arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association, containing an odd number of arbitrators, and shall take alternating turns striking the name of an arbitrator off the list until one name rem ains. Guarantor  shall strike the first name off the list.  \\nd. In no event shall the arbitrator be entitled to award punitive, \\nincidental, special or consequential damages against the Franchisor.  \\ne. Any award rendered in connection with an arbitration pursuant to  \\n  \\n  \\n this Section 84 shall be final and binding. The parties may initiate litigation in any court of \\ncompetent jurisdiction to confirm, enter and enforce such arbitration award. \\nf. Franchisor and Guarantor  agree that arbitration will be conducted \\nonly on an indivi dual, not a class -wide, basis, and that an arbitration proceeding between \\nFranchisor (including its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, managers, representatives and employees) and Guarantor (and the Franchisee)  may not be \\nconsolidated with any other arbitration proceeding between them and any other person or legal entity. No findings, conclusions, orders or awards emanating from any arbitration proceeding conducted hereunder may be introduced, referred to or used in any subsequent or other proceeding as a precedent, to collaterally estop any party from advancing any claim or defense or from raising any like or similar issues, or for any other purpose whatsoever. The parties agree that the principles of collateral estoppel shall not apply in any arbitration proceeding conducted under this Section. \\ng. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Franchisor may \\ninstitute litigation (without first proceeding with arbitration) exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction: (1) to prote ct the Principal Trademarks, any intellectual property \\nand Confidential Information; (2) to determine the validity of termination of this Agreement and/or any other related agreement; (3) to enforce the termination of this Agreement and/or any other relate d agreement; (4)  to enforce the Confidentiality, Non- Use \\nand Non- Competition Agreement and any other agreement executed by franchisee; (5) to \\nconfirm, enter and enforce an arbitrator’s award; (6) for monies owed; and (7) to enjoin or restrain Franchisee fr om otherwise causing immediate and irreparable harm to Franchisor, \\nits parent and/or its affiliates.   \\nh.

The California Department of Business Oversight  requires that certain provisions \\ncontained in the franchise documents for franchises offered or sold to either a resident of the State of California or non- resident who will be operating a franchise in the State of California be \\namended to be consistent wi th California law, including the California Franchise Investment Law \\n§§ 31000 through 31516, and the California Franchise Relations Act, California Business and Professions Code §§ 20000 through 20043 (collectively the “Acts”). To the extent that the Agreement contains provisions that are inconsistent with the following, such provisions are hereby amended and superseded:  \\n  a. The Acts provide rights to Franchisee concerning non- renewal and termination of \\nthe Agreement. The Federal Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. §101 et seq.) also provides rights to \\nFranchisee concerning termination of the Agreement upon certain bankruptcy- related events. To \\nthe extent the Agreement contains a provision that is inconsistent with these laws, these laws will control.    b. If the F ranchisee is required in the Agreement to execute a release of claims, such \\nrelease shall exclude claims arising under the Acts. California Corporations Code 31512 voids a waiver of Franchisee’s rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corpora tions Code \\n31000 through 31516). Business and Professions Code 20010 voids a waiver of Franchisee’s rights under the Franchise Relations Act (Business and Professions Code 20000 through 20043.   c. If the Agreement requires payment of liquidated damages that is inconsistent with \\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1671, the liquidated damage clause may be unenforceable.  \\n  d. If the Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extend beyond the \\nexpiration or termination of the Agreement, the covenant may be unenforceable under California law. \\n  e.

The Maryland Securities Division requires that certain provisions contained in the \\nfranchise documents offered or sold to either a resident of the State of Maryland or a non- resident \\nwho will be operating a franchise in the State of Maryland be amended to be consistent with Maryland law, including the Maryland Franchise Registration and Disclosure Law.

Item 17 is amended by the addition of the following language:  \\n \\nCalifornia Business and Professions Code Sections 20000 through 20043 \\nprovide rights to you concerning termination, transfer  or nonrenewal of a franchise. \\nIf the Franchise Agreement contains a provision that is inconsistent with the law, the law will control.   \\nThe Franchise Agreement provides for termination upon bankruptcy.

These provisions  to the extent  they dictate  \\nthe location  and governing law for occur  proceedings  are not permitted  under  the Illinois  \\nFranchise Disclosure  act. For Illinois  franchisees,  all court must be in Illinois under Illinois \\nlaw. \\n f. The following should be added to of Item 17 of this Disclosure Document: Your \\nrights upon non- renewal may be affected by Illinois law, 815 ILCS 705/19 and 705/20. \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\ng.

Item 17 of the Disclosure Document is amended by inserting the following provision:  \\n \\nNotwithstanding any other provision in this document, any release executed \\nin connection with the Franchise Agreement, whether upon renewal or transfer, will not apply to any claims that  may arise under the Franchise Disclosure Law and the \\nIndiana Deceptive Practices Act.  \\n2. The post termination covenant not to compete of the Disclosure Document shall \\nnot apply to a franchisee’s activities outside the  Territory.  \\n \\n3. Indiana law makes unilateral termination of a franchise unlawful unless there is a \\nmaterial violation of the Franchise Agreement and the termination is not done in bad faith.  \\n \\n4. If Indiana  law requires  the Franchise Agreement  and all related  documents  to be \\ngoverned by Indian a law, then nothing in the Franchise Agreement  or related  documents  referring \\nto Tennessee law will abrogate or reduce any of your rights as provided for under Indiana law.  \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nADDENDUM TO AMAZING ATHLETES FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, LLC  \\nDISCLOSURE DOCUMENT  \\nFOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND  \\n \\n \\nThe Disclosure Document is amended to include the following:  \\n1.

Section 101 et seq.)  \\n \\n5. Item 17 of the Disclosure Document is amended to state that the franchise agreement \\nprovides that disputes are resolved through arbitration. A Maryland franchise regulation states that it is an unfair or deceptive practice to require a franchisee to waive its rights to file a lawsuit in Maryland claiming a violation of the Maryland Franchise Law. In light of the Federal Arbitration Act, there is some dispute as to whether this forum selection requirement is legally enforceable.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nADDENDUM TO AMAZING AT HLETES FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, LLC  \\nDISCLOSURE DOCUMENT  \\nFOR THE STATE OF MINNESOTA \\n \\n1.

In addition, nothing in the disclosure document or agreement can abrogate or reduce any of your rights as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 80C, or your rights to any procedure, forum or remedies provided for by the l aws of the jurisdiction. \\nWith respect to franchises governed by Minnesota law, the Franchisor will comply \\nwith Minn. Stat. Sec. 80C. 14, Subs. 3, 4 and 5 which require, except in certain specified cases, that a franchisee be given 90 days’ notice of termin ation (with 60 days to cure) and \\n180 days’ notice for non- renewal of the Franchise Agreement.  \\nThe agreements contain a liquidated damages clause. Under Minn. Rule \\n2860.4400J liquidated damage clauses are prohibited. \\nWe will protect your right to use the Ma rks and/or indemnify you from any loss, \\ncosts or expenses arising out of any claim, suit or demand regarding the use of the Marks.  \\nMinn. Rule 2860.4400D prohibits us from requiring you to assent to a general \\nrelease. Any release you sign as a condition of renewal or transfer will not apply to any claims you may have under the Minnesota Franchise Law.  \\nFor Minnesota franchisees, to the extent the Franchise Agreement requires it to be \\ngoverned by a state’s law other than the State of Minnesota or provides for arbitration or mediation, these provisions shall not in any way abrogate or reduce any rights of the franchisee as provided for in the Minnesota Franchise Act, including the right to submit matters to the jurisdiction of the courts of Minnesota. \\nSection 80Cl7, Subd. 5. of the Minnesota Franchise Act states that no civil action \\nmay be commenced for violation of the Minnesota Franchise Act more than 3 years after the cause of action accrues. Section 18.3 of the Franchise Agreement contains certain time limits  on commencing actions. For Minnesota franchisees, to the extent that these \\nlimitations are inconsistent with those  under  the Minnesota  Franchise  Act, the \\nprovisions  of the franchise Agreement are superseded by the Minnesota Franchise Act’s \\nrequirements an d shall have no force or effect.  \\n Minn. Rule 2860.4400J prohibits you from consenting to us obtaining injunctive relief. \\nRather, where injunctive relief is provided for in the Franchise Agreement, you acknowledge that we may  seek injunctive relief. Further , in connection with injunctive \\nrelief, you and we acknowledge that a court will determine whether a bond is required.     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\nADDENDUM TO AMAZING ATHLETES FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, LLC  \\nDISCLOSURE DOCUMENT  \\nFOR THE STATE OF NEW YORK  \\n1.

Even if the area representative  agreement grants you a \\nterritory, the franchisor may have the right to  compete with you in your territory.   \\n \\nRenewal.   Your area representative  agreement may not permit you to renew.  Even if it \\ndoes, you may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order \\nto continue to operate your franchise busi ness.  \\n \\nWhen your franchise ends.

If so, you should check the State Addend a.  \\nSee the Table of Contents for the location of the State Addenda.  \\n Atomic Wings AR FDD 2021 B Special Risks to Consider About This Franchise  \\n \\nCertain states require that the following risk(s) be highlighted:  \\n \\n1. Out-of-State Dispute Resolution.   The area representative ag reement requires \\nyou to resolve disputes with the franchisor by arbitration and/or litigation only \\nin Maryland.  Out -of-state arbitration or litigation may force you to accept a less \\nfavorable settlement for disputes.  It may also cost more to arbitrate or  litigate \\nwith the franchisor in Maryland than in your own state.  \\n \\n2. Short Operating History.   The franchisor is at an early stage of development \\nand has a limited operating history.  This franchise is likely to be a riskier \\ninvestment than a franchisor i n a system with a longer operating history ca \\n \\n3. Financial Condition.   The f ranchisor ’s financial condition, as reflected in its \\nfinancial statements (see Item 21), calls into question the franchisor’s financial \\nability to provide services and support to you va \\n \\n4. Spousal Liability.   Your spouse must sign a document that makes your spouse \\nliable for all financial obligations under the franchise agreement even though \\nyour spouse has no ownership interest in the franchise.  This guarantee will place \\nboth your and your spouse’s marital and personal assets, perhaps including your \\nhouse, at risk if your franchise fails md \\n \\n5. Sales Performance Required.   You must maintain minimum sales performance \\nlevels.  Your inability to maintain these levels may result in loss of any territorial \\nrights you are granted, termination of your franchise, and loss of your \\ninvestment md \\n \\nCertain states may require other risks to be highlighted.  Check the “ State Addend a” \\n(if any) to see whether your state requires other risks to be highlighted.  \\n  \\nAtomic Wings AR FDD 2021 B \\n i TABLE O F CONTENTS  \\n \\nITEM 1

We  do business under our corporate \\nname and the Marks as described below.  In this Disclosure Document, we refer to the person or entity that \\nwill be signing the  Area Representative  Agreement (defined below) as “you” , “your” , or “ area \\nrepresentative ” which includes all owners and partners, if you are a corporation, partnership or other entity.  \\n \\n We are a franchising company which promotes and sells franchises for the operation of restaurants \\nknown as “ Atomic Wings ” (“Restaurant ”).  We began offer ing area representative franchises in August \\n2016.   We have never offer ed franchises in any other line of business and have not conducted business in \\nany other line of busi ness.  We do not own or operate a business of the type being franchised.

You are not \\nauthorized to grant franchises, negotiate sales, or to sign Franchise Agreements with franchisees.  New \\nfranchisee s will sign individual Franchise Agree ment s with us and not you.  You will share in a portion of \\nsome of the fees paid to us.  In addition, you may, in our discretion, share in certain expenses we incur to \\nenforce or defend Franchise Agreements or begin eviction proceedings against franchisees  in the \\nDevelopment Area.   \\n  \\nAtomic Wings AR FDD 2021 B \\n 2  You will : (a) be responsible for developing a certain number of Franchised Restaurant s within the \\nDevelopment Area and within a specific timeframe, and therefore must solicit, recruit, screen and interview \\nprospective franchis ees for us (“ Solicitation Services”); ( b) help us identify and secure sites for Restaurant s \\n(“Site Services”); ( c) provide additional  assistance and  support to franchisees upon opening  their \\nRestaurant s; and (d) conduct inspections of franchised Restaurant s at our request  (“Support Services”).    \\n \\nYou will receive 50% of the initial franchise fees paid  to us by  a franchisee who buys a Franchised \\nRestaurant in your Development Area , after deduction for  any fees or commissions paid to sales brokers or \\nsales agents  and subject to the following conditions :  (1) you collect preliminary financial and background \\ninformation, pre -qualify the franchisee using our criteria, and present us with the applicant; ( 2) both we and \\nthe franchisee sign the Franchise Agreement and the franchisee pays us the entire initial franchise fee ; (3) \\nthe sale is for a new Restaurant and is not a resale of an existing Franchised Restaurant by another \\nfranchisee; ( 4) there are no outs tanding sale contingencies, such as initial franchise fees that must be paid \\ninto an escrow account; and ( 5) you are in compliance with the ARA, including that you are current with \\nyour Development Schedule.  \\n \\n You will receive 50% of the aggregate royalty fees we receive from franchisees whose Franchised \\nRestaurant s are located in the Development Area for performing Support Services in compliance with the \\nARA.  If you fail to perform Support Services for any franchisee in your Development Area, we may \\nterminate your ARA  or we may reduce the percentage of r oyalty fees to which  you would otherwise be \\nentitled.  You will also receive 30% of any transfer fees  related to Franchised Restaurants locat ed within \\nthe Development Area ; however , you are not entitled to any share of transfer fees related to Franchised \\nRestaurants that you or your affiliates own and transfer or that you or your affiliates purchase .  You will \\nnot receive any portion of the mar keting and advertising fees  or any other fees  that we collect from \\nfranchisees, whether inside or outside the Development Area.   You are permitted to own, operate and \\nmaintain Franchised Restaurants within the Development Area, which will count toward sati sfaction of \\nyour Development Schedule.   For any Franchised Restaurant you own and operate in the Development \\nArea, you will receive 50% of the initial franchise fees paid to us by you and 50% of the royalt y fees paid \\nto us by you.  \\n \\n While we rely on you t o present us with those applicants whom you pre -qualify using our criteria, \\nwe make the final decision on whether we will sell a franchise to the candidates you present.  If we approve \\nthe candidate, we and the candidate will sign a Franchise Agreement, an d you are not a party to that contract.  \\n \\nMarket and Competition  \\n \\nThe ma rket for restaurants featuring b uffalo -style chicken wings and related products is well -\\nestablished.  People of all ages consume the p roducts offered by Atomic Wings  restaurants on a year -round \\nbasis.  In each market, you will compete with “mom and pop” restaurants, as well as national and regional \\nrestaurant chains, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Wing Zone, Wing Stop and Buffalo’s Southwest Café.  \\nSome of our competit ors have longer operating histories than ours.  This market is fairly developed, and the \\ngoods and services offered are not seasonal in nature.  \\n  \\n You will compete with other franchisors, area representatives, sales brokers and others offering \\nquick -service restaurant franchises.  The market for quality quick -service restaurants in general is well \\ndeveloped and intensely competitive . \\n \\nIndustry Regulations  \\n \\n You must comply with the FTC Rule and franchise registration and disclosure laws in vario us \\nstates.   The Disclosure Document must be registered with the various authorities before the offer or sale of  \\nAtomic Wings AR FDD 2021 B \\n 3 any franchise in that particular state, and the state may require that you register as a subfranchisor or \\nfranchise broker.  The franchisor must  be registered in a franchise registration state before the area \\nrepresentative may offer franchises for sale.   We will provide you with an electronic copy of our applicable \\nDisclosure Document, which you will use to sell franchises for us.  \\n \\n You must deli ver an approved Disclosure Document to each pote ntial franchisee and multi -unit \\noperator  prospect before any franchise or multi -unit operator sale and must comply with the requirements \\nof federal and state franchise laws.  You and your officers, directors,  managers and employees are not our \\nagents and may not contractually obligate us unless we specifically authorize you to do so in writing.  Area \\nRepresentatives do no t offer franchises or multi -unit operator opportunities for sale in their territories, but  \\ninstead, their officers and sales employees operate as our salespersons.  Accordingly, in most states, you do \\nnot separately register a Disclosure Document.  Instead, you deliver a salesman disclosure form along with \\nour Disclosure Document to each pros pective franchisee or multi -unit operator .  If your state requires that \\nyou must separately register as a broker or seller of franchises, we will assist you in preparing your broker \\napplication or Disclosure Document, but you must pay the entire cost of prep aring your broker application \\nor Disclosure Document and registering as a broker or a subfranchisor.  \\n \\n In addition to complying with federal and state franchising laws, you must comply with the \\nfollowing industry -specific regulations:  ( a) federal immigrat ion laws, tax laws, unemployment and \\nworkers’ compensation laws, employment and discrimination laws, disability laws, environmental laws and \\nproduct labeling laws; and ( b) federal, state and local health, building and zoning codes.  The details of \\nfederal,  state, county and local laws and regulations vary from place to place and you must make sure that \\nyou are familiar with these laws.  \\n \\nOther Related Business Activities  \\n \\n The area representative will also offer multi -unit franchises.

We have the right to periodically change our approved suppliers, and we have the right to \\nnegotiate price and other terms with our approved suppliers for the benefit of the System.  A complete list \\nof our approved products and suppliers wi ll be included in the Manual and is subject to change over time.  \\nThere might be situations where you can obtain items from any supplier who can satisfy our requirements \\nand, therefore, would be an approved supplier.

We have  the right to change our insurance requirements during the \\nterm of your ARA , including the types of coverage and the amounts of coverage , and you must comply \\nwith those changes.   If you do not obtain the insurance coverages that we require we may, but are not \\nobligated to, obtain insurance on your behalf and you must reimburse our expenses related to obtaining \\ninsurance for you, together w ith a 10% administrative fee.  \\n \\n For each Atomic Wings  Restaurant you own and operate, you must also carry the insurance policies \\nthat we require under the Franchise Agreement for the Restaurant.  \\n \\nITEM 9  \\nFRANCHISEE’S OBLIGATIONS  \\n \\n This table lists your principal obligations under the franchise and other agreements.

The \\nDevelopment Area is typically described in terms of municipal or county boundaries.  This is your protected  \\nterritory.  The actual size of the Development A rea will vary depending upon the availability of contiguous \\nmarkets, our long-range development plans, your financial and operational resources,  population and \\nmarket conditions.  Our designation of a particular Development Area is not an assurance or warr anty that \\nthere are a sufficient number of suitable sites for Restaurants in the Development Area for you to meet your \\nDevelopment Schedule.  You are solely responsible for all of your obligations under the ARA, including \\nthe responsibility to locate and p repare a sufficient number of suitable sites and we have no obligation to \\napprove sites which do not meet our criteria for you to meet the Development Schedule.  \\n \\nYou will not receive an exclusive territory.  You may face competition from other franchisees,  from \\noutlets that we own, from other channels of distribution or competitive brands that we control.  \\n \\nDuring the term of the ARA, and as long as you are in full compliance with all of the terms and \\nconditions of the ARA, we will not  own or operate or lice nse others to own or operate as an area \\nrepresentative in the Development Area . \\n \\n We will retain the right to solicit Atomic Wings  franchisees both inside and outside your \\nDevelopment Area.   We may recruit prospective franchisees and sell franchises for lo cations in your \\nDevelopment Area , but you will still earn a portion of the initial franchise fee for franchises that we sell in \\nyour Development Area.  Although we are under no obligation to do so, we intend to turn over to you all \\nof the sales leads that we receive from prospects looking to acquire an Atomic Wings franchise for a location \\nin your Development Area so that you can pre -qualify the candidate.  Because we may not approve a \\nfranchisee’s location until after we sign the Franchise Agreement, it is  possible that you could pre -qualify \\na franchisee who ultimately selects a site outside of your Development Area and in another Area \\nRepresentative’s Development Area.  In that case, you would earn a portion of the initial franchise fee for  \\nAtomic Wings AR FDD 2021 B \\n 14 the sale of tha t franchise, but the Area Representative in whose area the franchisee opens the Restaurant \\nwould receive a portion of the royalty fees and any transfer fees paid on account of that franchisee.  \\n \\n To maintain  your rights under the ARA  there must be open and in operation the cumulative number \\nof Restaurant s stated on the Development Schedule by the dates agreed upon in the Development Schedule.    \\nIf you fail to meet the Development Schedule, we h ave the right to terminate the ARA . \\n \\nWe have the right to use alternative methods of distribution within the Development Area under \\nour principal trademarks  or different trademarks .  There is nothing that limits our right to maintain websites  \\nor to offer and sell products and services from a system website, another w ebsite or otherwise over the \\ninternet .  We are not required to pay you any compensation if we accept orders from inside the Development \\nArea.    \\n \\nYou are not permitted to  market outside of the Development Area and you do not have the right to \\nuse other chan nels of distribution s such as internet, catalog sales, telemarketing or direct marketing without \\nour permission.  You are strictly prohibited from establishing your own website related to the Proprietary \\nMarks or our System without our prior written consen t.  You are also prohibited from promoting your AR \\nBusiness  on social and networking websites, including, but not limited to, Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace \\nor Twitter, without our prior written consent.    \\n \\nWe and our affiliates may establish other franchised or company outlets under the Proprietary  \\nMarks and/or under other marks that may compete with your Development Area.  We and our affiliates \\nmay merchandise and distribute goods and services identified by the Proprietary Marks through meth ods \\nor channels of distribution .   \\n \\n In addition, upon completion of the Development Schedule , your  development rights under the \\nARA  with respect to soliciting  or developing franchises in the Development Area will terminate and we \\nwill have the right to operate and to grant to others development rights and franchises to develop and operate \\nRestaurant s within the Development Area.  Your rights and obligations to service the franchisees within \\nthe Development Area will continue until the ARA  is terminated or expires, according to the terms of the \\nARA .  This right will be subject only to the territorial rights under the franchise agreements signed by you \\nand other f ranchisees for Restaurant s in the Development Area.  The Development Area may not be altered \\nor relocated  unless we mutually agree to do so .  You are not granted any other option, right of first refusal \\nor similar right to acquire additional Restaurant s in your Development Area under the ARA .   \\n \\nThere are no minimum sales goals, market penetration or other contingency that you must meet to \\nkeep the exclusivity of your Development Area, except that you must meet your Development Schedule.  \\n \\nITEM 13  \\nTRADEMARKS  \\n \\n The ARA  grant s you the right to use certain trademarks, trade names, service marks, symbols, \\nemblems, logos and indicia of origin designated by us, including the Marks described in Item 1  and below .  \\nThese Marks may be used only in the manner we authori ze and only for the operation of your AR Business . \\n \\n You may not use the Marks as a part of your corporate or other legal name, and you must comply \\nwith our instructions in filing and maintaining trade name or fictitious name registrations.

INC. \\n(An S Corporation) \\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \\n \\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  \\nBusiness Activity \\nAtomic Wings Franchisor Inc. (“the Company”) was in corporated in the \\nState of New Jersey on July 12, 2006. Its principal  operation is the sale of \\nfranchises of restaurants called, “Atomic Wings”, w hich offer buffalo-\\nstyle chicken wing products as the menu focal point . The company derives \\nincome from franchise fees and royalties from franc hisees.  \\n \\nBasis of Accounting \\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented  using the accrual \\nbasis of accounting in accordance with accounting p rinciples generally \\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). \\n \\nProperty and Equipment \\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and are  depreciated using the \\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful live s of the assets which are \\nfive years for automobiles, three to ten years for computer and office \\nequipment, seven tears for furniture and fixtures, and the term of the lease \\nfor leasehold improvements. \\n \\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets and all intan gible assets for \\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstan ce indicate that the \\ncarrying amount of such assets may not be recoverab le. Any long-lived \\nassets held for disposal are reported at the lower of their carrying amount \\nor fair value less cost to sell. \\n \\nUse of Estimates \\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformi ty with accounting \\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America requires \\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions about future events. \\nThese estimates and assumptions affect the reported  amounts of assets and \\nliabilities and disclosures of contingent assets an d liabilities at the date of \\nthe financial statements, as well as reported amoun ts of revenues and \\nexpenses during the reporting period. Management ev aluates the estimates  \\n \\n(7)  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5220 S UNIVERSITY DRIVE \\nSUITE C-102 \\nDAVIE, FL 33328 \\n \\n20801 BISCAYNE BLVD \\n4th FLOOR \\nAVENTURA, FL 33180 \\n \\nT. 305.944.9755 \\nF. 888.401.1914 \\n \\nwww.silvasfinancialservices.com \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historica l experience and other \\nfactors that management believes to be reasonable u nder the \\ncircumstances. Adjustments to estimates and assumpt ions are made as \\nfacts and circumstances require. As future events a nd their effects cannot \\nbe determined with certainty, actual results could differ from the estimates \\nand assumptions used in preparing the accompanying financial statements. \\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are required as part of determining \\nthe value of accounts receivable and estimating dep reciation. \\n \\nRevenue Recognition \\nRevenue is recognized when services have occurred a nd the amount of \\nrevenue is measurable. Revenue from the sale of pro ducts is recognized \\nwhen there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  and the product has \\nbeen accepted by the customer (franchisee). \\n \\nInitial franchise fees are recognized upon finaliza tion of the franchise \\nagreement and completion of services required under  the operations \\nagreement related to the opening of a franchise. Ma ster (area) franchise \\nfees are recognized upon execution of the franchise  agreement and the \\nmaster franchise attaining the ability to open and sell franchises within the \\ndesignated area. The company recognizes royalty fee s monthly, as earned. \\nSubcontractor revenue is recognized when the servic es have occurred. \\n \\nIncome Taxes \\nThe Company, with the consent of its shareholders, has elected under the \\nInternal Revenue Code to be an S Corporation. In li eu of corporation \\nincome taxes, the shareholders of an S Corporation are taxed on their \\nproportionate share of the Company’s taxable income ; therefore, no \\nprovision or liability for federal income taxes has  been included in these \\nfinancial statements.  \\n \\nNote 2 – Property and Equipment \\n \\nProperty and equipment at December 31 consist of th e following: \\n \\n   Year  End                 Year  End              \\n 12/31/2019  12/31/2020 \\nOffice Furniture & Fixtures           \\n5,939.57                5,939.57  \\nAccumulated Depreciation -        4,914.60   -            5,229.68  \\n   Total Property and Equipment           \\n1,024.97                   709.89  \\n \\n(8)   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5220 S UNIVERSITY DRIVE \\nSUITE C-102 \\nDAVIE, FL 33328 \\n \\n20801 BISCAYNE BLVD \\n4th FLOOR \\nAVENTURA, FL 33180 \\n \\nT. 305.944.9755 \\nF. 888.401.1914 \\n \\nwww.silvasfinancialservices.com \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Note 3 – Other Assets \\n \\nOther Assets at December 31 consist of the followin g: \\n \\n \\n   Year  End                 Year  End              \\n 12/31/2019  12/31/2020 \\nOrganization Cost       123,719.00            123,719.00  \\nAccum.

The Company’s \\nmaster franchise agreements do not have benchmarks for the number of \\nbusinesses to be opened and operational. Master fra nchises generate 2.5% \\nroyalties based on gross revenues from all franchis es within their \\ndesignated area.

(“the Company”) was in corporated in the \\nState of New Jersey on July 12, 2006. Its principal  operation is the sale of \\nfranchises of restaurants called, “Atomic Wings”, w hich offer buffalo-\\nstyle chicken wing products as the menu focal point . The company derives \\nincome from franchise fees and royalties from franc hisees.  \\n \\nBasis of Accounting \\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented  using the accrual \\nbasis of accounting in accordance with accounting p rinciples generally \\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). \\n \\nProperty and Equipment \\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and are  depreciated using the \\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful live s of the assets which are \\nfive years for automobiles, three to ten years for computer and office \\nequipment, seven tears for furniture and fixtures, and the term of the lease \\nfor leasehold improvements. \\n \\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets and all intan gible assets for \\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstan ce indicate that the \\ncarrying amount of such assets may not be recoverab le. Any long-lived \\nassets held for disposal are reported at the lower of their carrying amount \\nor fair value less cost to sell. \\n \\nUse of Estimates \\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformi ty with accounting \\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America requires \\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions about future events. \\nThese estimates and assumptions affect the reported  amounts of assets and \\nliabilities and disclosures of contingent assets an d liabilities at the date of \\nthe financial statements, as well as reported amoun ts of revenues and \\nexpenses during the reporting period. Management ev aluates the estimates  \\n \\n(7)  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5220 S UNIVERSITY DRIVE \\nSUITE C-102 \\nDAVIE, FL 33328 \\n \\n20801 BISCAYNE BLVD \\n4th FLOOR \\nAVENTURA, FL 33180 \\n \\nT. 305.944.9755 \\nF. 888.401.1914 \\n \\nwww.silvasfinancialservices.com \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historica l experience and other \\nfactors that management believes to be reasonable u nder the \\ncircumstances. Adjustments to estimates and assumpt ions are made as \\nfacts and circumstances require. As future events a nd their effects cannot \\nbe determined with certainty, actual results could differ from the estimates \\nand assumptions used in preparing the accompanying financial statements. \\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are required as part of determining \\nthe value of accounts receivable and estimating dep reciation. \\n \\nRevenue Recognition \\nRevenue is recognized when services have occurred a nd the amount of \\nrevenue is measurable. Revenue from the sale of pro ducts is recognized \\nwhen there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  and the product has \\nbeen accepted by the customer (franchisee). \\n \\nInitial franchise fees are recognized upon finaliza tion of the franchise \\nagreement and completion of services required under  the operations \\nagreement related to the opening of a franchise. Ma ster (area) franchise \\nfees are recognized upon execution of the franchise  agreement and the \\nmaster franchise attaining the ability to open and sell franchises within the \\ndesignated area. The company recognizes royalty fee s monthly, as earned. \\nSubcontractor revenue is recognized when the servic es have occurred. \\n \\nIncome Taxes \\nThe Company, with the consent of its shareholders, has elected under the \\nInternal Revenue Code to be an S Corporation. In li eu of corporation \\nincome taxes, the shareholders of an S Corporation are taxed on their \\nproportionate share of the Company’s taxable income ; therefore, no \\nprovision or liability for federal income taxes has  been included in these \\nfinancial statements.  \\n \\nNote 2 – Property and Equipment \\n \\nProperty and equipment at December 31 consist of th e following: \\n \\n   Year  End                 Year  End              \\n 12/31/2018   12/31/2019  \\nOffice Furniture & Fixtures         5.939,57       5.939,57  \\nAccumulated Depreciation -      4.454,49   -   4.914,60  \\n   Total Property and Equipment         1.485,08       1.024,97  \\n \\n(8)   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5220 S UNIVERSITY DRIVE \\nSUITE C-102 \\nDAVIE, FL 33328 \\n \\n20801 BISCAYNE BLVD \\n4th FLOOR \\nAVENTURA, FL 33180 \\n \\nT. 305.944.9755 \\nF. 888.401.1914 \\n \\nwww.silvasfinancialservices.com \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Note 3 – Other Assets \\n \\nOther Assets at December 31 consist of the followin g: \\n \\n   Year  End                 Year  End              \\n 12/31/2018   12/31/2019  \\nOrganization Cost     123.719,00     123.719,00  \\nAccum.

The Company’s \\nmaster franchise agreements do not have benchmarks for the number of \\nbusinesses to be opened and operational. Master fra nchises generate 2.5% \\nroyalties based on gross revenues from all franchis es within their \\ndesignated area. The Company remits the master fran chise royalties from \\nthe 5% royalties assessed on gross revenue; accordi ngly, for franchises \\nwith a master franchise, the Company realizes 2.5% royalties on gross \\nrevenues. \\n \\nFranchise fee revenue from individual and master fr anchise sales is \\nrecognized when substantially all services related to the sale have been \\nperformed. \\n \\nFor individual franchise sales, substantial perform ance is satisfied when \\nthe owner is trained and the franchise is operation al. For master franchise \\nsales, substantial performance is satisfied when th e owner is trained. \\nBecause the Company’s master franchises do not requ ire a designated \\nnumber of franchise businesses to be established, s ubstantial performance \\nis satisfied when the owner is trained. \\n \\nAs territory is assigned to each franchise sold, th e Company may reach the \\npoint where existing markets become saturated and i nitial franchising \\nrevenue declines.

Pursuant to an Area Representative Agreement dated       \\n(the “Area Representative Agreement”), Area Representative has acquired the right and franch ise from \\nAtomic Wings Franchisor Inc ., a New Jersey corporation  (the “Company”) to establish and operate a n \\n“Atomic Wings ” area representative business (the “ AR Business”) and the right to use in the operation of \\nthe AR Business the Company’s trade names, service marks, trademarks, logos, emblems, and indici a of \\norigin (the “Proprietary Marks”), as they may be changed, improved and further developed from time to \\ntime in the Company’s sole discretion . \\n \\n 2. The Company,  as the result  of the expenditure  of time,  skill,  effort  and resources  has \\ndeveloped  and owns  a distinctive  format  and system  (the “System”)  relating  to the establishment  and \\noperation  of Atomic Wings restaurants (“Franchised Business”) .  The Company possesses certain \\nproprietary and confidential information relating to the operation of the Sy stem, which includes certain \\nproprietary trade secrets, methods, techniques, formats, specifications, systems, procedures, methods of \\nbusiness practices and management, sales and promotional techniques and knowledge of, and experience \\nin, the operation of the Franchised Business (the “Confidential Information”).  \\n \\n 3. Any and all information, knowledge, know -how, and techniques which the Company \\nspecifically designates as confidential shall be deemed to be Confidential Information for purposes of this \\nAgreem ent. \\n \\n 4. As ________ of the Area Representative, the Company and Area Representative will \\ndisclose the Confidential Information to me in furnishing to me training programs, the Company’s \\nConfidential Operations Manuals (the “Manuals”), and other general a ssistance during the term of the Area \\nRepresentative Agreement.  \\n \\n 5. I will not acquire any interest in the Confidential Information, other than the right to utilize \\nit in the operation of the AR Business during the term of the Area Representative Agreemen t, and the use \\nor duplication of the Confidential Information for any use outside the System would constitute an unfair \\nmethod of competition.  \\n \\n 6. The Confidential Information is proprietary, involves trade secrets of the Company, and is \\ndisclosed to me s olely on the condition that I agree, and I do hereby agree, that I shall hold in strict \\nconfidence all Confidential Information and all other information designated by the Company as \\nconfidential.  Unless the Company otherwise agrees in writing, I will dis close and/or use the Confidential \\nInformation only in connection with my duties as ________________ of the Area Representative, and will \\ncontinue not to disclose any such information even after I cease to be in that position and will not use any \\nsuch infor mation even after I cease to be in that position unless I can demonstrate that such information has \\nbecome generally known or easily accessible other than by the breach of an obligation of Area \\nRepresentative under the Area Representative Agreement.  \\n Atomic Wings ARA 2021 i  \\n 2  7. Except as otherwise approved in writing by the Company, I shall not, while in my position \\nwith the Area Representative, either directly or indirectly for myself, or through, on behalf of, or in \\nconjunction with any person, persons, partnership, or corporati on, own, maintain, operate, engage in, act as \\na consultant for, perform services for, or have any interest in any business which:  (a) is the same as, or \\nsubstantially similar to, the Franchised Business; or (b) offers to sell or sells any products or serv ices which \\nare the same as, or substantially similar to, any of the products offered by a Franchised Business  (a \\n“Competitive Business”); and for a continuous uninterrupted period commencing upon the cessation or \\ntermination of my position with Area Repres entative, regardless of the cause for termination, or upon the \\nexpiration, termination, transfer, or assignment of the Area Representative Agreement, whichever occurs \\nfirst, and continuing for two (2) years thereafter, either directly or indirectly, for my self, or through, on \\nbehalf of, or in conjunction with any person, persons, partnership, or corporation, own, maintain, operate, \\nengage in, act as a consultant for, perform services for, or have any interest in any Competitive Business \\nthat is, or is inten ded to be, located at or within:  \\n \\n  7.1 The Development Area, as defined in the Area Representative Agreement;  \\n \\n  7.2 Twenty (20) miles  of the Development Area; or  \\n \\n  7.3 Twenty (20) miles  of any  AR Business or Atomic Wings  Restaurant operating \\nunder the S ystem and the Proprietary Marks.  \\n \\n The prohibitions in this Paragraph 7 do not apply to my interests in or activities performed in \\nconnection with a Franchised Business.  This restriction does not apply to my ownership of less than five \\npercent (5%) benefi cial interest in the outstanding securities of any publicly held corporation.  \\n \\n 8. I agree that each of the foregoing covenants shall be construed as independent of any other \\ncovenant or provision of this Agreement.  If all or any portion of a covenant in this Agreement is held \\nunreasonable or unenforceable by a court or agency having valid jurisdiction in an unappealed final decision \\nto which the Company is a party, I expressly agree to be bound by any lesser covenant subsumed within \\nthe terms of such covenant that imposes the maximum duty permitted by law, as if the resulting covenant \\nwere separately stated in and made a part of this Agreement.  \\n \\n 9.

The Company  is a third -party beneficiary of this Agreement and may enforce it, solely \\nand/or jointly with the Area Representative.  I am aware that my violation of this Agreement will cause the \\nCompany and the Area Representative irreparable harm; therefore, I acknow ledge and agree that the Area \\nRepresentative and/or the Company may apply for the issuance of an injunction preventing me from \\nviolating this Agreement, and I agree to pay the Area Representative and the Company all the costs it/they \\nincur(s), including, w ithout limitation, legal fees and expenses, if this Agreement is enforced against me.  \\nDue to the importance of this Agreement to the Area Representative and the Company, any claim I have \\nagainst the Area Representative or the Company is a separate matter and does not entitle me to violate, or \\njustify any violation of this Agreement.  \\n \\n 11.
